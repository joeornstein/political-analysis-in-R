Good evening.

RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: Good evening, Chris. Thanks, my friend. Have a fantastic weekend.

HAYES: You too.

MADDOW: Thanks at home for being with us on a Friday night. Happy Friday.

Here is the thing I do not get to say very often. Today was a day full of good news when it comes to whether or not, we`re going to stay a democracy in our lifetimes. We have been covering this beat pretty relentlessly for the past several years now as you know.

The Republican Party over the past several years, they have more and more overtly embraced Donald Trump`s denunciation of elections, the promotion of false claims about elections to undermine faith in them, the rejection of clear election results, the promotion of changes to election administration that would allow Republicans to subvert election results that they don`t like. It has been a bleak thing to cover, right? The news on this beat is always bad.

If January 6th was supposed to be a shock to the system that was going the reset the Republican Party away from this very dangerous course, it worked for like one day and then it really did not work. The embrace of all this very dark anti-democracy, you know, rule by force stuff in the Republican Party has just gotten worse and worse.

Even since January 6th. It is a drag. It has just been a drag to cover it, I will tell you honestly.

But today, bright spots. Not being sarcastic. Bright spots on a bunch of different fronts. Let me tell you about some of them.

First of all, in terms of accountability, CNN first to report tonight that one of the key alleged plotters with Trump in the senior levels of his Justice Department is finally going to come forward and testify.

This is Jeff Clark. Mr. Clark with Trump hatched this scheme by which the Justice Department would hold a press conference after the election and declare at that press conference that there were serious fraud problems in the election in multiple states and the Justice Department was investigating these very serious problems. He then wanted to send a letter to swing states that Biden won, a letter from the Justice Department, advising officials in those states that the Justice Department thought there were serious problems with the elections in those states, and Republican state legislators should therefore, you know, start investigating the election results or whatever. They should get to work on whatever they needed to do to not send Biden electors to the Electoral College even though in reality Biden won those states.

That was the Jeff Clark plan. We know from the Senate Judiciary Committee`s investigation of these matters. And we know that the plan, while it had a lot of detail in it and they took a lot of acts of furtherance toward it, the reason it fell apart was because the then-attorney general, a guy named Jeff Rosen, wouldn`t sign on to it.

When Rosen wouldn`t side off on it, wouldn`t allow this plot to go forward, Trump then tried to replace Rosen with Jeff Clark, tried to install Jeff Clark himself as attorney general, so the Clark plan would go ahead. Again, to have the Justice Department declared serious fraud in the election and to direct states to therefore not send their Biden electors. It was absolutely insane.

It was also a rational plan, that they didn`t just spit ball about. They didn`t just fantasize about it. They drafted the letter to the states. He did insist on the press conference to other Justice Department officials. The Justice Department officials even tried to on-board U.S. attorneys, federal prosecutors in the relevant states to back them up on these spurious fraud claims they were going to use to keep Trump in power even though he lost the election.

Just saying this, right. Like I said, news on this front has been absolutely terrible as we learned of all of the things they tried. But in today`s news a little glimmer with the news that Jeff Clark has apparently finally agreed to testify to the committee that is investigating the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol.

I mentioned that a lot of the Clark plot emerged both from public source reporting, particularly in ""The New York Times"" but also from the Senate judiciary committee`s investigation into what happened at the Justice Department around this time.

The Senate Judiciary Committee has been investigating how Trump used the Justice Department to try to seize power and stay in office after losing the election.

Interestingly, for their preliminary report, which was released a couple of weeks ago, they had a lot of information about what Jeff Clark did but all of the information they had about him was from other people. They couldn`t get Clark to testify himself because Republican senators on the Senate judiciary committee apparently blocked the committee from giving a subpoena to Jeff Clark. They wouldn`t allow a subpoena to him to go forward.

[21:05:01]

Republicans didn`t want to hear from him, and so Jeff Clark did not speak to them. But the House Committee that`s investigating the January 6th attack, they apparently do not have that problem, and so, Clark is going to be coming in this day next week to speak to the January 6th investigation. Progress.

And this news comes, of course, just after the full house voted yesterday, all the Democrats and nine Republicans voted yesterday that another important witness for that investigation, maybe a subject of that investigation, I don`t know, should be referred to the Justice Department for potential prosecution for him defying a subpoena to give testimony to that committee. That criminal referral of Trump adviser Steve Bannon is now at the U.S. attorney`s office in Washington, D.C.

They will consider it independently and make their own decision about whether or not to bring charges. We are waiting to see if and when they will put Steve Bannon on trial in that matter. But, again, the prospect of accountability there, that`s a glimmer.

Those glimmers today also arrive alongside a bizarre turn today for a Trump lawyer named John Eastman. He`s an obscure figure who got famous through this whole scandal when he wrote the notorious Eastman memo which laid out the theory of the case basically behind the January 6th attack on the Capitol. What Trump demanded of the crowd at that rally January 6th, before his supporters rushed to the Capitol, what Trump demanded of them, what people like Eastman himself and other speakers that day told the mob they would accomplish if they, in Trump`s words, fought like hell that day was a specific thing. It was this scenario that was laid out in Eastman`s memo in which he said the vice president, Mike Pence, shouldn`t accept the electors from swing states that Biden won. The memo laid out how vice president Mike Pence had the right not to accept those electors, and that`s how the electoral count could be stopped, that`s how the naming of Biden as the winner of the election could be technically stopped.

John Eastman is the one who laid out the memo for how the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol, which did stop the counting process for some time, he laid out the memo for how the attack on the Capitol that day could work, particularly if Pence went along with it, this is how it could work.

Well, today, bizarrely, that lawyer, John Eastman, the guy who wrote out this quasi legal theory of the case which they used to justify Republican members of Congress objecting to the electoral count which they used to try to get Mike Pence to go along with the scheme, today in ""National Review"", that lawyer John Eastman sort of walked it all back. He didn`t say he changed his mind. He said that was never what he meant in the first place.

He tried to pretend he didn`t write what he wrote in his memo. He is denying he meant it. He now says it was a draft, and, of course, if anybody had gone along with any of this, that would be crazy, which is insane but also in its own way is progress, right?

It would be a worse scenario if the people who tried to layout this quasi legal theory for how Trump could have stayed in power, if they were still defending that and saying that was the way elections and post-election behavior should proceed in future years. Instead, it is progress. It is a form of accountability to see the lawyer who propounded that in writing saying, that wasn`t me, that wasn`t me, it must be a different John Eastman.

Also today in Wisconsin, more progress. You know how Republicans all over the country are pursuing these reviews of the 2020 election results, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Texas, Wisconsin, all over the place? They`re pursuing these reviews which they`re calling audits or forensic audits. They want to make it seem like they`re running some rigorous process and investigating some kind of known crime scene.

All of these things are nonsense. They are designed simply to muddy the waters around the clear election results. Trying to make election administration seem controversial or rigged or somehow partisan. They`re trying to rarefy these vague assertions of fraud, right, of the election somehow being stolen so Republicans would be conditioned to not accept election results in the future when Republicans lose elections, right?

They are using these reviews and audits to justify perverting the election administration system so partisan figures can mess with or throw out inconvenient results in the future. These things are terrible. They are toxic. They are actively dangerous.

But interestingly, in Wisconsin, where they`ve got one of those nonsense ones, they`ve actually had two audits under way and we had really interesting and, I would say, sort of positive developments on both of them today.

[21:10:03]

The first of them is one of these nonsense, you know, Cyber Ninjas partisan things they`re using taxpayer money for, but the Republicans in the Wisconsin state legislature literally put this thing in the hands of a guy who led the stop-the-steal stolen election rallies in Michigan after the election, a guy who subsequently Trump tried to give a federal appointment to. I am sure he will be a non-partisan arbiter of this matter.

Today, there was, I think, a sign of progress toward exposing and perhaps ending that ridiculous exercise that that very partisan figure in Wisconsin is heading up on behalf of the state`s Republicans. Today, Wisconsin State Attorney General Josh Kaul asked a judge to throw out the subpoenas this guy has sent out as part of his purported investigation. He told the court that those subpoenas were sent, quote, in furtherance of an unlawful investigation focused on debunked theories about the November 2020 election.

Now, we`ll see how the courts handle this request from Wisconsin`s attorney general, but as a general matter, I think in asking the courts to evaluate the means by which Republicans are trying to carry out these fake audits is a good step toward bringing some order, some oversight, some accountability to this otherwise very dangerous, slip shod process that we`ve seen unfold in multiple states.

So an effort to bring the courts in to effectively police that nonsense that Republicans are trying to pull off in Wisconsin, very interesting. That court case will be important. Also today, also in Wisconsin, a totally separate audit carried out legitimately by the professional, qualified, non-partisan legislative audit bureau in Wisconsin, today that actually real audit conducted by people who know how to do audits, for whom that is their actual professional responsibility within the state.

Today, they submitted their findings of a real audit, a real review of how the election went in Wisconsin this past year, and it turns out in their findings -- again, they`re professional, qualified, sober, non-partisan find instance, what they found was actually everything was fine.

Here is the ""Associated Press"" on that today in Wisconsin. You see the headline there, Wisconsin audit finds elections are safe and secure.

Here is the lead. A highly anticipated non-partisan audit of the 2020 presidential election in Wisconsin released today did not identify any widespread fraud in the battleground state, which a key Republican legislative leader said shows Wisconsin`s elections are, quote, safe and secure.

So, yes, Republicans in Wisconsin are persisting with their clown show audit, but it is now being forced to go through some hoops set by potentially the courts in Wisconsin, which is probably a good thing, rationalizing that process, opening it up to public scrutiny, not letting them just do whatever they want and call it an investigation. And simultaneously, today also they were forced to admit after a real audit that actually everything was fine with the election results there, right. Hello, progress. Nice to meet you.

I realize maybe this is the soft bigotry of low expectations, like maybe I am seeing silver linings in what are very, very dark clouds and I`m overplaying the silver, but after such bleak news on this front for so long those are positive developments.

Also progress today in Florida, all of the county election supervisors in Florida, a bipartisan group of them that represents the top election official from each of Florida`s 67 Florida counties, those county election officials in Florida have put out a joint bipartisan statement now, calling on all public officials in the state to, quote, tone it down and stop making false fraud claims about the election.

They say, quote, the great American experiment, our cherished democracy, is under threat. Our nation is only as strong as the faith our citizens have that their voice, their vote has a say in our government. In this hour, public trust in our elections is being systematically undermined to the detriment of all Americans. As the official trusted sources of election information and experts in our field, we continuously strive to debunk false claims and insure voters have access to accurate election information.

They continue, quote, false claims of fraud -- false claims of fraud do not strengthen our elections. Instead, they degrade confidence in the institutions and discourage citizen participation in our democracy.

During and after the 2020 presidential election, the integrity of our democracy has been challenged by misinformation, disinformation and malinformation that sows discord and undermines thrust in the process. Many have been threatened by fellow citizens who have been led astray by these deceptions.

[21:10:02]

Instead of standing idly by, we ask all candidates and all elected officials to tone down the rhetoric and stand up for our democracy. Again, that is a bipartisan statement from the Florida supervisors of elections, from all of the top election administrators in all of Florida`s 67 counties, Democrats and Republicans, all telling all elected officials to knock it off with the false claims about fraud in elections. Progress.

That is a good sign. I told you, there is a bunch of promising news on this front today, but I will close, I will leave you with one more. Sort of to me shocking, definitely bizarre collapse of a Republican and conservative media scheme in the state of Nevada to promote false allegations of fraud in the presidential election in the state of Nevada. This is an amazing story.

All right. Joe Biden beat Donald Trump in Nevada by just under 34,000 votes. Nevada is one of the states where Trump nevertheless sued to have the results overturned, to have himself declared the winner. He sued to have the results decertified. He actually asked the courts to just declare him the winner, even though the certified vote total said that Biden won.

The reason he said the election should be overturned and he should be declared the winner is because he said the Republican Party and the Trump campaign knew that there was so much fraud in the Nevada election. Specifically, they alleged there were tons and tons of dead people who voted in Nevada, which means live people voted in dead people`s names. You can`t do that. They said they had tons of proof of that.

Now, Republicans and the conservative media specifically hyped the case of one ballot that was cast in Nevada in the name of a woman who died in 2017 at the age of 52, a very sad story. She died of breast cancer. She has been dead since 2017. Her address was apparently nevertheless mailed a ballot in her name, but her husband says he never saw any such ballot, no such ballot ever arrived.

But the county, Clark County, Nevada, where he and his former -- and his late wife lived, he says the county nevertheless recorded her vote as having been cast and counted. Fraud, voter fraud.

Conservative and Republican groups held a big press conference in Nevada the week after the election, saying that this case proved that the election in Nevada was lousy with voter fraud. Sure, there was just this one example they had to talk about, but surely if there was this clear case of a ballot being cast and counted from this woman who was dead, then there must be hundreds, there must be thousands. The whole election in Nevada must be thrown out for all the dead people voters. Look at this one case, it is clearly an exemplar of what must be many, many, many of these cases.

They held up that big conference about it, very well-attended, very well- covered in the media. Then in the national media, over on the Fox News Channel, they went hog wild with it.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: So was there voter fraud last week? That`s a question we`ve been working on since election night. We have tried to be careful and precise as we report this out. In moments like this truth really matters more than ever. False allegations of fraud can cause as much damage as the fraud itself, and the last thing America needs right now is more damage.

So we want to be accurate. What we`re about to tell you is accurate. It is not a theory. It happened and we can prove it.

Other news organizations could prove it, too. They`ve simply chosen not to. A former elementary school teacher called Rosemary Hartle.

According to her 2017 obituary, Rosemary Hartle was fun, loving, sarcastic in a powerful way, relentless and inspiring. Sadly, now, she is gone but her voter registration remains. She is still on the rolls.

Someone received Rosemary Hartle`s ballot in the mail and then cast it. Who did this? We don`t know who did it. We wish we did. We should know.

It`s fraud. It is a threat to our system, and it is being hidden by a news media totally vested in a Joe Biden presidency. Again, we have a right to know. We have an obligation to know much more about this.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MADDOW: Again, that case being used to tell Americans writ large whatever you have heard about voter fraud in the election, about there being massive fraud in the election, this case proves it. This case shows you that the Democrats stole it, and the extrapolation from this one case to try to prove that there was widespread fraud was quite overt.

I mean, no doubt excited by the kind of press they were getting on the Fox News Channel on this one, the Nevada state Republican Party just hyped this individual case relentlessly.

[21:20:05]

They hyped this over and over again as all of the evidence you need that there must have been tons of fraud in the election, that the whole Nevada election should be thrown out. That Biden definitely didn`t win because look at this woman`s case. That hyping by the state Republican Party in Nevada included this sort of morbid tweet in which they actually posted the woman`s obituary alongside their statement. Kirk was surprised to find that his late wife, rosemary, a Republican, cast a ballot in this year`s election despite having passed away in 2017. The media needs to understand we are finding concrete cases of voter irregularities they must expose.

Again, they showed the screen shot of the woman`s obituary scolding the media on this. In another tweet hyping the same case they linked to video of Kirk, of the woman`s husband, in this case speaking with a local station in Clark County, Nevada.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD ""KIRK"" HARTLE, HUSBAND: It was disbelief, just it made no sense to me. But it lent to credence to, you know, what you have been hearing in the media about these possibilities and now it makes me wonder how pervasive is this.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MADDOW: He was shocked. Disbelief. It just made no sense to me. Shocked to find out a ballot had been cast in his dead wife`s name. Shocked, it made no sense. Now that he knows it happened, he just went there, this obviously lends credence to all these claims you are hearing about, about all of the voter fraud in the election. There must be tons of it. It just makes me wonder how pervasive this is.

Now that man, the husband, has been charged with two felony counts of voter fraud because according to prosecutors, according to Nevada state attorney general`s prosecution division, he is actually the one who cast the ballot in the name of his dead wife in addition to his own ballot, which means if the prosecutors in this case are correct he probably wasn`t all that shocked. Shocked and in disbelief to learn that her ballot had been cast since he`s the one who cast it.

But he nevertheless put himself out there to become the poster boy for these false claims of fraud that Republicans and the conservative media used and are still using to claim that the election was stolen. He`s an executive at a company that had taken a very positive and public pro-Trump stance and actually hosted an event for president Trump in Nevada just before the November election last year. He`s been charged with these two felony counts. He is facing up to eight years in prison. He will have his initial court appearance next month in Nevada.

This beat, this effort by Republicans and the conservative media to make Americans not belief in election results anymore, it is still a depressing beat and we will stay on it because it is the most important story in modern history. But some days, you know, some days, even as this beat is relentlessly depressing and it does feel like it just keeps getting worse, some days are good days.

Some days schemes get exposed. Schemers get caught. Good people stand up, bad guys are caught and the real facts come out. Some days are good days.

This is a good day.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[21:27:30]

MADDOW: Let me start here by saying this is not a typical story that we cover on this show, not our usual thing. But it is a compelling story and it is all right. It is a legitimate mystery and I want to tell you it connects with something we`ve been covering intensely recently.

Recently in the show, we have been covering how Americans are going on strike all over the country, more than 10,000 people who work at the John Deere company are in their ninth day of their strike against that company for better wages and benefits, 1,400 Americans working at the Kellogg`s Cereal company are in the third week of that strike in multiple states. Tens of thousands of people who are health care workers at Kaiser Hospital System in California, Oregon and Hawaii, they may also go on strike. I mean, that would be tens of thousands of people. That would be huge. That decision could come at any time.

This week 300 flight attendants working for a subsidiary of American Airlines voted to authorize a strike. In Philly, we learned that transit workers there may strike. And in Hollywood, another huge one. It was last week when 60,000 stage crew workers in Hollywood came within hours of launching what would have been the biggest strike in that industry since World War II.

The union IATSE represents the vast majority of Hollywood stage crew, everybody from makeup artists to camera and microphone operators to stage hands of all kinds. Last week just hours before the 60,000 people were due to walk off the job, the studios did offer up an improved deal for those workers. Whether it is a good enough deal, those workers are still going to have to decide, still going to have to vote on whether they`re going to accept the new terms. Until they do, the threat of that historic strike still looms.

But that is turning out to be part of the relevant backdrop for this truly bizarre and terrible story that we all woke up to this morning that nobody in the country seems to be able to avoid talking about all day long. By now you have seen the headlines.

Yesterday on the set of a western filming in New Mexico, the actor Alec Baldwin fired a gun that was supposed to be a prop in a scene. The resulting shot killed the film`s cinematographer, 42-year-old woman named Halyna Hutchins. She was considered to be a rising star in her field. Again, she was the cinematographer.

The film`s director was injured in this incident. He has since been released from the hospital. When it comes to figure out how it could happen, the questions to the fore are mystifying. How does a prop gun result in a real shooting?

[21:30:02]

In some cases, a prop gun is something that`s not a gun at all, it has no working parts, just made out of rubber and plastic designed to have a gun shape. But if you are watching a movie or TV show and you see somebody actually fire a weapon, you hear the bang, you see the flash, chances are that is either special effects or that could be a real gun firing a blank bullet.

What is a blank bullet? This is a diagram ""USA Today"" posted today which I think is useful. For an actual piece of ammunition, one that is designed to shoot someone, there`s several parts. There`s the casing, the primer, the powder, gun powder, and the bullet which is at the tip of the projectile. That`s the thing that`s supposed to be able to kill you, right.

The primer and the powder are the things that make the bullet propel out of the gun. That`s the stuff that goes bang and lets off the flash, but it is the bullet that is the actual projectile that`s fired out of the end of the barrel.

Now, if a gun is loaded with a blank, that just means it has all of the other component pieces that a real piece of ammunition has minus the bullet itself, minus the projectile designed to actually kill you. Just because they`re blanks though doesn`t mean they`re not dangerous.

I mean go back to that diagram showing the blank for a second. Can we pit it back up? You see where it says ""wad sealed with plastic or paper, released like a projectile."" there isn`t a chunk of metal on the end, a bullet, but you need to stick something in there to seal in the gun powder. They use wadding or paper, it poses less danger than a bullet but if fired at close enough range a blank can injure or kill someone.

It is technically missing the bullet but even a blank can be dangerous, even a blank can be deadly. It happened on movie sets before. In 1984, an actor named John Eric Hexum was joking around on the set of a film with a real prop gun that was filled with blanks. He shot himself in the head at close rang. The force of that blank fractured his skull and he died.

There`s also the potential to misload a gun. This happened on a movie set in 1993. The actor Brandon Lee, the son of the great Bruce Lee, was starring in a movie where his character was supposed to get shot in the stomach, but when another actor fired a real prop gun in his direction, the prop gun loaded with blanks, turns out the gun had been misloaded. It hadn`t been checked properly when it was loaded with blanks. There was an actual bullet, a real bullet accidentally lodged in the chamber of that prop gun. When the gun went off, it did fire a blank but it also dislodged the real bullet which hit Brandon Lee in the abdomen and killed him.

So, yes, they are prop guns of various kinds used in various ways, but these things are so dangerous a lot of productions don`t use them at all anymore. The show ""Mayor of East Town"" that was on HBO earlier this year, Kate Winslet plays the police detective, it is not a spoiler but a lot of guns are fired on that show. Kate Winslet is a cop and on ""Mayor of East Town"" for that whole show they decided every firing of every gun would all be CGI, it was all special effects.

They didn`t use prop guns loaded with blanks. They, you know, maybe lost the authentic recoil and the live muzzle flash that they would have gotten from using blanks, but they decided it wasn`t worth the risk. They added in all of the effects after the fact, and a lot of productions do that now.

But a lot of movie and TV sets still use real guns. The prop master who handles all props for all purposes on the set, if there are guns being used, that person can sometimes be assisted by a specialist, an armorer, somebody who specializes in weaponry for film and TV sets.

Now, as you can imagine, the entertainment industry has really strict rules for using firearms onset. This is some of the -- from the industry wide labor management safety commission, these are some of the safety bulletins they`ve put out about guns onset. Look what this one says right at the top in all capital letters, blanks can kill. Treat all firearms as though they are loaded. Then it is pages and pages of rules trying to head off any tragic accidents like the one we saw yesterday in New Mexico.

Number one, refrain from pointing a firearm at anyone including yourself. If it is absolutely necessary to do so on camera, consult the prop master. Number two, never place your finger on the trigger until you`re ready to shoot. Keep your finger alongside the firearm and off the trigger. Number three, know where and what your intended target is. This goes on and on and on.

To state the very obvious, clearly something broke down on this film set yesterday in New Mexico when a crew member was killed and another seriously injured when an actor discharged a prop gun. We don`t know where the breakdown of safety protocols occurred, but how did it -- how could it have happened?

[21:35:07]

Just in the last hour, we learned from the ""AP"" it was the assistant director of the film who reportedly handed the prop gun to Alec Baldwin before the incident happened. According to court documents obtained by the ""AP"", the assistant director did not know the weapon contained a round, a live round. I should tell you in movie speak a live round can also mean a blank. For the purposeless of being on a movie set, anything that can be fired out of a gun, blank or bullet, is considered to be a live round.

In terms of what killed the cinematographer and injured the director, we don`t even know if it was a blank that was discharged from the weapon. Could it have been an actual live bullet as was the case with Brandon Lee? It is being investigated now by the Santa Fe County Sheriff`s Office.

But let me bring it back to the beginning now. Beyond the immediate tragedy here and the absolutely flummoxing mystery of what went wrong and how it could have gone wrong, this story does also intersect in an interesting way with the story we`ve been watching unfold over the country in recent weeks, right, where American workers of all kinds in all sorts of different industries have been advocating for changes in their workplace, advocating for, you know, better pay, better benefits, but also safer and more sustainable working conditions. Like I said, this activism has included the entertainment industry just this past week. It has only been a couple of days since tens of thousands of workers in Hollywood`s biggest union threatened to walk off the job for better and safer working conditions.

We are learning tonight and getting information this dynamic of workers all over the country demanding better working conditions, that dynamic was on play on this movie set where this happened and it was at play hours before the fatal incident occurred. ""The L.A. Times"" is reporting tonight just hours before this incident where the cinematographer was killed and the director was injured, just hours before, half a dozen camera crew workers walked off that same set to protest working conditions.

Quote, the camera operators and their assistants were frustrated by the conditions surrounding the low-budget film, including complaints of long hours and complaints about getting their paychecks. So, the morning of the incident, the camera crew arrived for their 6:30 a.m. call time but according to ""The L.A. Times"", they packed up their gear and walked off the set.

One crew member telling ""The Times"" that the cinematographer that was killed had been using her clout onset to advocate for better working conditions for her team. One of the camera crew workers left the set in protest -- excuse me. Once the camera crew workers left the set in protest yesterday, ""The L.A. Times"" reports that the film production brought in nonunion crew members to replace them and ordered all remaining union workers to leave for the day.

Now, typically, onset the prop master, the person in charge of making sure guns are handled and used safely, traditionally that itself is a union role but today the local union covering the prop master says no member of their union was onset at the time of the incident. It gets more worrying.

NBC News is reporting this evening among the safety concerns raised by the workers who walked off the set yesterday were concerns over the fact that the prop gun involved in this incident, the same gun, had reportedly misfired multiple times previously on this set. ""The L.A. Times"" has further reporting on this tonight. I will quote from what they just posted. Baldwin`s stunt double accidentally fired two rounds on Saturday after being told the gun was cold, lingo for a women that doesn`t have any ammunition including blanks. That`s according to two crew members who talked to ""The L.A. Times"" about it.

One crew member telling ""The Times"", there should have been an investigation into what happened, there were no safety meetings. There was no assurance that it wouldn`t happen again. All they wanted to do was rush.

Again, according to ""The L.A. Times"" tonight, one colleague was so alarmed by the prop gun misfires he sent a text message to the unit production manager saying, quote, we`ve now had three accidental discharges, this is super unsafe.

Look, there`s so much we do not know right now. We have no idea where or when or why the breakdown in gun safety protocol happened, we don`t even know the basics of what was fired out of the prop gun. We know there was trouble onset preceding the incident, as recently as the morning before it happened with crew members complaining about safety conditions onset including around that gun. We don`t know if that played an immediate role at all in how things fell apart here, fatally.

What else can we know at this point about exactly what happened here?

We`ve got an expert on hand to help us out with this next.

Stay with us.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[21:44:04]

MADDOW: This was a picture that Halyna Hutchins posted to her Instagram account last week. It is a picture of the cast of the movie ""Rust"" and it is captioned, standing in solidarity with our crew here in new Mexico on ""Rust."" Again, ""Rust"" was the name of the movie.

When she is referencing solidarity was the labor action by the film and television workers union who were at the time threatening a massive strike in Hollywood, the biggest strike since World War II among -- over among other things what they saw as inadequate workplace safety for film crew members.

We still don`t know if IATSE is going to go on strike, that labor action is sort of still pending while its members decide whether or not they`re going to vote to accept new terms they received from studios last week. But this has a whole different cast now.

Halyna Hutchins died on the set of that movie yesterday after a prop gun that shouldn`t have been able to hurt anybody fired a projectile of some kind which shot and killed her while she was working on set.

[21:45:09]

It is a set that reportedly had labor problems of its own, including a walk-off by some IATSE members as recently as yesterday morning before the incident happened. We are learning more tonight, that there was reportedly a series of issues with the prop guns on set that were cause for safety concerns among crew members before yesterday.

Still lots of unanswered questions here. Joining us is Steve Wolf. He is a weapons safety expert for films. He was involved in the investigation into the accidental shooting death of Brandon Lee during a movie seat in 1993.

Mr. Wolf, it is a pleasure to have you with us tonight. Thank you.

STEVE WOLF, WEAPONS SAFETY EXPERT: Rachel, it is a pleasure to be with you. I almost feel like you don`t need me. You`ve really got this.

MADDOW: Well, let me ask if I explained any of this wrong when I was talking about blanks and the difference between blanks and bullets, that`s the way it is supposed to be explained?

WOLF: You nailed it. You could have done, you know, ten times the job that was done on the Baldwin set.

MADDOW: Well, let me ask you about this.

WOLF: This is --

MADDOW: Go ahead, please.

WOLF: This is the thing that would be a blank round, just a casing and some gun powder. This is live ammo , the thing used to shoot at things. So, you know, hard to get these wrong, which is which.

One issue though has been referring to this weapon as a prop weapon. A prop is anything that an actor touches. If an actor touches their cellphone, you know, this is a prop.

Well, if I touch this gun it is a prop. That doesn`t make it a prop gun though. It is a gun that`s being used as a prop. A prop gun has been modified so that you cannot introduce live ammo to it.

Live ammo simply -- sorry about that. Live ammo simply won`t go into a prop gun, only blanks will go in. So it is not that they were killed with -- you know, he was killed with a prop gun. He was killed with a real gun, and presumably now what we`re hearing, you know, actual live ammo .

Also, when we say going live onset as you said, going live doesn`t mean we are using live ammo. It means we are about to do something noisy, that we`re really doing the real thing. We`re going live, we`re going to blow up the car. We`re going live, we`re loading the gun with the blanks.

You know, it doesn`t mean we are putting real ammunition, bullets into guns capable of firing them and then handling them onset.

MADDOW: Steve, because of all of the safety protocols that are used including as you just described, like making sure you are using a realistic looking weapon that is operable but it can`t be loaded with live ammunition, the kind of safety rules that I just showed that are standard in terms of what people are -- how people are trained to work around these kinds of firearms onset because of what we know about this sort of industry standards around safety briefings for everybody involved in a shoot that`s got a firearm involved in it in any way, it just seems very surprising given the current state of how these things are handled in the industry that this could happen. It seems like there`s so many safeguards this should be impossible.

WOLF: Yes. It is to the point where you can`t hurt somebody by breaking a rule. You can hurt someone if you break multiple rules. So when you use an unmodified firearm that can accept live ammo.

When you put that live ammo in it, when you point the gun at a person, you have now broken three rules that lead you down the road towards accidental homicides. Any one of these things -- you know, let`s say you have a live gun and put real ammo in it but when you pointed it and observe the rule you don`t point guns at things you don`t want to put holes in, there wouldn`t have been a fatality. A bullet whizzing past everyone`s head, oh, my God, it is an unsafe set and I`m leaving, but no one would have been killed. You have to break a bunch of rules.

Also, talk about the gun misfiring, when a gun misfires it doesn`t go off. So, the gun didn`t misfire on the previous days. It was accidentally discharged.

I`m not sure how it can accident -- you know, having had guns around my whole life, I have never seen a gun go off by itself. Guns go off when you -- let me check it is clear. Guns go off when you press the trigger. It is an intentional act, and so we shouldn`t confuse intentional acts from accident.

The gun didn`t accidentally go off. The gun was put in the hands of a person, the person did not check if there was anything in it, and then they pressed the trigger twice. That`s why the gun went off.

MADDOW: Hmm.

WOLF: It was unsafe handling and unsafe supervision.

MADDOW: And the supervision and the labor conditions here are going to dovetail in terms of consequences of this act are, but we should keep in mind --

[21:50:08]

WOLF: True.

MADDOW: -- we should keep in mind first and foremost right now, there`s a police investigation into what happened here, and we expect that the Santa Fe Sheriff`s Office will let us know more than we know now.

WOLF: Yeah. From what I`m looking at now, you know, I believe that charges should be filed. To introduce live ammo with bullets in it to a movie set is absolutely unconscionable. It put that into the hands of an actor and not tell the actor, under no circumstances should you point this at anyone unless you intend to commit murder.

I`m pretty sure that Alec Baldwin, had he been told that, would not have pointed the gun at anyone. No one told him that, and if they did, they weren`t watching to see he was following directions.

So, we have all the safety meetings (ph) you want, but if we`ll are going to break the rules, then those meetings mean nothing, and the rules mean nothing. Simple common sense, don`t bring live guns on set. Don`t bring live ammo on set. Don`t point guns at people that you don`t want to put holes into. It`s not much more complicated than that (INAUDIBLE)

MADDOW: Steve Wolf, professional stuntman, film weapons safety expert, spelling this out in a way that is very, very clear. Steve, thank you for helping us understand tonight. I really appreciate it.

WOLF: Rachel, thanks so much. Appreciate it.

MADDOW: All right. We`ve got more ahead tonight. Stay with us.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[21:55:29]

MADDOW: The Supreme Court of the United States is not a vehicle that is built for speed. Deciding whether to take a case, setting a date for arguments, eventually ruling, it`s like cold molasses, even on urgent issues, except today.

Today, the United States Supreme Court did something quite remarkable. They agreed that they`re going to hear the Texas abortion ban case, okay? But they agreed that they`re going to hear it a week and a half from now. That`s lightning for them.

Law professor Steve Vladeck pointing out today he can`t think of any recent precedent except for Bush v. Gore where the court acted so stunningly fast.

The arguments are going to be on November 1st, which is very, very soon. Still the court deliberately allowed the Texas abortion ban to stay in place while they consider the matter, and they didn`t have to do that.

Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor offering a blistering dissent, saying in part today, the promise of future adjudication offers cold comfort for Texas women seeking abortion care who are entitled to relief now. These women will suffer personal harm from delaying their medical care and as their pregnancies progress, they may be even unable to obtain abortion care altogether because every day the court fails to grant relief is devastating both for individual women and for our constitutional system as a whole. She says, quote, I dissent.

Abortion rights on the chopping block this term for the high court and very, very fast.

Watch this space.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

MADDOW: All right. That is going to do it for us tonight. I do want to mention before I go that MSNBC has a new documentary that`s going to air this weekend on Sunday night. It`s called ""Civil War, or Who Do We Think We Are?""

It`s really good, really well done, really thought provoking. The executive producer is Brad Pitt, if that tells you anything. That is going to air right here on MSNBC this Sunday at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time. You should watch it.

That`s going to do it for me tonight.

It`s time for ""THE LAST WORD"" with Ali Velshi filling in for Lawrence tonight.

Good evening, Ali"
2021-10-22,All In With Chris Hayes,MSNBC,Chris Hayes,"CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST (voice-over): Tonight on ALL IN. From cursing the President on the House floor to scoring political points after a tragic death on a movie set. Tonight, how the shock jock caucus has taken over the Republican Party.

Then, one day after the contempt vote for Bannon, a key actor in the DOJ coup comes forward. Tonight, what we know about Jeffrey Clark`s deposition.

Plus, why critics are saying Trump`s social media platform could be his biggest scam yet. And then demonstration on how not to explain the Build Back Better agenda from our old friend, Mitt.

SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): Just to give you some perspective, a trillion seconds ago, Neanderthals run the earth.

HAYES: When ALL IN starts right now.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES (on camera): Good evening from New York, I`m Chris Hayes. You know, in general, politicians try to be likable and try to appeal to people, being an obnoxious jerk, generally not the best bet in public office or public or public life. Of course, there are exceptions. I mean, there have been all sorts of awful scoundrels throughout history who have thrived in public life.

There`s something happening right now, in this moment, particularly in the political right, that is incentivizing, cultivating nastiness as a political virtue. And I think it`s part of something that`s broader and more broken with the way that our political coalitions are functioning.

Here`s what got me thinking about this today this morning. Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance, Republican, tweeted ""Dear Jack, as Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and CEO of Twitter, let Trump back on we. Need Alec Baldwin tweets.

Vance is referencing the truly horrifying news that`s of course in escapable. Today, actor Alec Baldwin was involved in a fatal accidental shooting involving a prop gun while filming a movie called Rust near Santa Fe, New Mexico. Just before we got on air, the Associated Press reported that Baldwin was handed a loaded weapon by an assistant director who indicated it was safe to use and the moments before the actor fatally shot a cinematographer.

That executive assistant director did not know the prop gun was loaded with live rounds according to court records released today. Baldwin killed the film`s cinematographer, a woman named Halyna Hutchins and wounded the director. Thankfully, the director is now out of the hospital. Law enforcement has not charged anyone at this time. In a statement, Baldwin said he is cooperating with investigators and wrote, ""My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna.""

I mean, this is just an unfathomably terrible situation. And of course, look, humans often deal with terrible thing. Dark humor is part of our coping mechanisms. But J.D. Vance is running for office, who wants to represent millions of Ohioans. He wants to be in the United States Senate, and the first thing he does, reading this news like there`s a woman who`s dead, her family is grieving, her children, everyone around her is grieving, and these awful things happens and he`s kind of to write a gloating joke about it on Twitter. Like, won`t that be funny? Won`t that trigger people?

It`s a shtick, of course. It`s your shtick. I know. It`s meant to trigger people like me. But it`s a weird thing when you think about it. He`s not a morning shock jock going out of his way to trigger people, performing being a bad person, whether he really is or not, because he thinks there`s an appetite for it politically.

He`s a guy running for Senate. Of course, he`s right. He`s correct. There`s an appetite. People want it. That`s what Donald Trump proved. And it`s not just coming from J.D. Vance. Again, it`s it -- he`s doing a very pathetic shtick that`s very transparent and almost hard to watch. But it`s become a broader ethos on the right.

I`ve been noticing it and thinking about it. Like, conservatives, they have this term they like to throw at liberals, virtue signaling. And that`s what they say liberals are doing when liberals express concern about things like quality or social justice, and to conservatives, and I think a lot of them really believe this, that it`s not real those concerns with equity or social justice. It`s a kind of performative etiquette.

And again, that`s not a crazy critique. I think sometimes it is true that people are virtue signaling. But I`ve come to think of what those on the right like J.D. Vance are doing now as vice signaling. Look at me, I am a loud, ostentatious jerk. That is increasingly what it means to be a right- wing politician in America these days, which again, is weird. It`s perverse.

Take Congressman Bill Posey, a Republican of Florida. He`s been around a while. He`s a guy who he signed on to the Texas Attorney General`s lawsuit attempting to overturn the election in 2009. Shortly after he entered Congress, he introduced a racist birther bill requiring presidential candidates to provide a copy of their birth certificate. We all know what that was about.

And yesterday, while railing against Democrats and Joe Biden`s Build Back Better plan on the House floor, he embraced another gross message.

[20:05:0]

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. BILL POSEY (R-FL): People are understandably frustrated. Actually, they`re very angry and they`re not going to sit back and take it much longer. Instead of the bogus Build Back Better plan and reconciliation plan, you know what they want? They want you to help put America back where you found it and leave it the hell alone. Let`s go Brandon.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: Let`s go Brandon might sound like a bizarre ending for that speech. You may have followed this. It`s actually a right-wing euphemism for F Joe Biden. It came about just weeks ago at a NASCAR race when reporter suggested to driver Brandon Brown the crowd was cheering let`s go Brandon in his honor, but anyone watching could hear clearly that`s not what the crowd was cheering.

Senator Ted Cruz, a person who I think really pioneered like being super unlikable and being elected retweeted a video of himself repeating the phrase at the Houston Astros game the other day. And again, play whatever. It`s a dumb little troll. We`re all grown up here. One of the great things about living in a free country is you could tell the president to eff off. That`s fine.

But again, like who`s this -- who is this for? What`s the audience here, right? It says something about who Congressman Posey and Senator Cruz particularly again, who`s like, really up there in unlikability and using that, right, what they think their audience wants to hear.

And here`s the crucial thing. This is deeper than just rhetoric. Stay with me here. There`s a connection between this vice-signaling and a profoundly broken part of right-wing politics that actually are imperiling all of us. The right has convinced their base that they are basically being deceived by the entire structure of mainstream establishment American life, the media, science, public health, all of it.

They have convinced them that all of those people are out to get conservatives, that they cannot trust anything from anyone who is not also a committed diehard right-winger. And that is an extremely useful tool in the hands of people seeking and wielding power.

It was on display in this video from Congressman Jeff Fortenberry who we covered -- of Nebraska when he posted on Monday speaking from his vintage pickup truck with his wife and dog when he revealed he expected to be indicted for lying to the FBI about illegal donations to his campaign.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. JEFF FORTENBERRY (R-NE): I told them what I knew and what I understood. They`ve accused me of lying to them and are charging me with this. We`re shocked. We`re stunned. I feel so personally betrayed. We thought we were trying to help.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: Now, Fortenberry was indicted the next day charged with lying the FBI who he felt personally betrayed him. And there`s all kinds of people coming to his defense on the right because they view the FBI of all things as a sucking horse for Democrats.

Now, there`s nothing wrong with skepticism to the law enforcement. In fact, that`s a central principle of good journalism is to be skeptical to law enforcement, OK. But you can see how useful it is when anything that contradicts the conservative worldview, or that would seem to reflect poorly on a right-wing politician can be discounted, and just given the metaphorical finger.

Now, whatever it is, that comes out of the vast world out there, vaccine advisor, moving to get rid of Confederate statues in public places, or legal charges, like all of it`s just from these people that hate you and look down on you and you want to tell them to go F themselves and don`t listen to it.

And that brings us of course to congressman Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida. Recently, Gaetz has been on an America first tour with Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene holding Trump-style rallies around the country. He`s a kind of, you know, MAGA hype man.

He`s also a troll. This is what he does. He wear gas masks on the House floor in March of 2020, mocking concerns about the Coronavirus that was about to kill hundreds and hundreds of hundreds of 1000s of people, and impose immense human suffering and misery, which was very funny to him.

He`s a backbencher. He has no accomplishments to speak of whatsoever. He`s a legacy case, the son of a prominent Florida politician with an infamous mug shot from DUI arrest in 2008. That`s who he is. It`s not like an impressive dude. It`s just -- it`s just this guy. He`s troll whose daddy was a politician.

Well, he wears all that as a badge of honor. And right now, he is facing the kind of allegation that`s generally pretty tough to overcome as a politician. Gaetz is being investigated for child sex trafficking. Put those three words together and put it underneath a politician, child sex trafficking.

Federal authorities are looking into whether Gaetz broke the law by providing goods or services in exchange for sex with a child, a child, a 17-year-old girl. Investigators believe that an associate of Gaetz, a former Florida official named Joel Greenberg connected with women online through websites meant to facilitate dates and exchange for gifts, fine dining, travel, and cash allowances.

Mr. Greenberg would then introduce the women to Mr. Gaetz who also had sex with them in Florida hotels. Although we should say here, women is not correct because the accusation that it was a child. Greenberg pleaded guilty to multiple crimes including sex trafficking of a minor earlier this year and is cooperating with federal authorities. Gaetz denies he paid for sex or had sex with a minor.

[20:10:13]

Yesterday, the New York Times reported by the Department of Justice has added two top prosecutors to the Gaetz case, a sign of the complex and high stakes nature of the inquiry. The prosecutors want a public corruption investigator with an expertise in child exploitation crimes, and the other top leader of the public corruption unit have been working on the Florida- based investigation for at least three months according to two people briefed on the matter.

The Times also reports to Joel Greenberg told authorities that he saw Mr. Gaetz and others have sex with the underage girl. He saw Matt Gaetz have sex with a child. Greenberg made the same claim in a letter he wrote while trying to get a pardon from Donald Trump as a daily beast reported back in April.

In any other universe, a member of Congress facing an investigation, I guess it again, it`s just investigations, and it`s an allegation, but a serious one of alleged sex trafficking of a minor. That`s some pretty serious stuff. It`s serious stuff at a moral level, it`s serious stuff at the legal level, you think it`d be pretty serious stuff at a political level.

But Matt Gaetz, and again, perhaps not wrongly, thinks that the vice- signaling impulse among his base is strong enough that he can survive. The impulse to discount whatever all the pointy-headed elites in the New York Times and the FBI, whoever else says, the ability to make people believe that`s all nonsense, or maybe that it`s true, and they don`t care, because you`re sticking your finger in the eye of them. And that is the dangerous political superpower that all of these people, Matt Gaetz included, are desperate to develop.

Michael Schmidt is a Pulitzer Prize-winning correspondent at the New York Times where he reported on those new details about the investigation to Matt Gaetz today. And he joins me now. Michael, first, just take us through your reporting on the status of the investigation, some people being added to the team. I think are officially added about three months ago and have been working on this. Who they are and what import, we can infer from them.

MICHAEL SCHMIDT, CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: So whenever you have a member of Congress, or a big time politician around the country under investigation in something that is serious and serious, like this case, you are -- the case is aided and overseen by a prosecutor from Washington, someone who has a lot of expertise in these types of cases.

And that is what has happened here. We have had these two senior corruption prosecutors from Washington added to the local federal investigation being led by investigators in Orlando, into Gaetz. And those investigators have a massive decision to make. And that is a decision whether to charge Gaetz with sex trafficking of a minor the same thing as you were pointing out that Joe Greenberg has associated has been charged with.

That charge comes with the 10-year mandatory minimum. That means that if you plead guilty to it, you`re found guilty to it, you`re almost certainly going to be spending 10 years in prison. Bringing charges against anyone is a very serious thing, obviously. Doing it to a member of Congress is even a bigger deal because of the perception of politics in that. A 10-year mandatory minimum is even another level of seriousness in the entire thing.

And that is the decision that the Garland Justice Department will have to make in the coming weeks and months. Are they going to indict him on this massive charge which would almost certainly go to trial?

HAYES: Yes. And just to be clear, I mean, what -- the significance is that we`re this just an investigation of Joel Greenberg who we know is cooperating with prosecutors and was going to stop there, you wouldn`t be getting public integrity prosecutors from D.C. on the case.

I mean, their presence, which is reported and established by you, it`s like, yes, they`re looking at Matt Gaetz. I mean, that`s -- I think that`s unquestioned. Tell me about what Greenberg has said or what we know about the status of his cooperation, because obviously he is the key witness here.

SCHMIDT: So, the federal government had a massive amount of leverage against him because Joel Greenberg committed a bunch of different crimes. As a local tax collector in Florida, he took money, he committed fraud, he -- other corruption charges. There`s just a massive amount of time that he could spend in prison.

So, he pled guilty, and his lawyer Fritz Schiller agreed to a cooperation agreement that forced him to tell the government everything he knew. And he told the government, as you had pointed out at the top of your show, that he saw on that Gaetz have sex with this 17-year-old girl. He was an eyewitness to that.

[20:15:06]

Now, in any type of investigation that involves sex in these, you know, very significant allegations, you are going to need as many witnesses as possible as much evidence as possible.

So, the government has not only received that testimony from Joel Greenberg, but his lawyer has provided them with documentation that backs up Greenberg`s accounts, whether it`s Venmo, you know, transactions that he had with the women or that he had with Matt Gaetz or different hotel receipts from when they spend time together with these women.

And what the government will do is they will look at all this. They will look at the documentation, they will look at what Joe Greenberg says. They will look to see whether other witnesses backup, Joel Greenberg`s account. And you know, what type of witness would Joel Greenberg be on the stand? What type of -- you know -- you know, if -- when the 17-year-old girl is called, what would that testimony look like? These are all the decisions that have to go into what they are going to do with Matt Gaetz.

HAYES: Just the final point here -- and obviously Gaetz denies this. He denies paying for sex with anyone. He denies ever having had sex with anyone underage. That -- it`s also established. Like Greenberg and Gaetz or associates. Like we know -- it`s not -- this is not coming out of thin air. You know, these two men work together, knew each other. There`s pictures of them, etcetera.

SCHMIDT: Correct. Joel Greenberg was someone who wanted to be an up and comer in Florida State Republican politics. He saw his way into that through people like Matt Gaetz, and not just building a relationship with Matt Gaetz, but bringing Matt Gaetz along with the things that he was doing. You know -- you know, soliciting women, you know, to have sex with them, buying drugs, you know, having these parties in hotel rooms.

These were all ways that Joe Greenberg was ingratiating himself with other local Republicans in Florida state politics. And that is how this relationship came together and how it leads to this point where the Garland Justice Department will have to decide whether to indict one of Donald Trump`s most vocal allies on Capitol Hill, someone who has gone to extreme lengths to embrace Donald Trump, his rhetoric, and to -- you know, to advocate for him.

HAYES: Michael Schmidt, thank you very much. I appreciate it.

Just one day after the House voted to hold Steve Bannon in contempt of Congress, we can report the January 6 Committee has gotten its first really high-profile person to testify. The former DOJ official who reportedly helped plot a coup with Donald Trump, nearly sending the country to the brink, is expected to answer questions about his role and attempting to overturn the election. We`ll talk about it with a member of the January 6 Committee next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[20:20:00]

HAYES: Donald Trump has always wanted to be known as one of the world`s richest men even when he wasn`t. As the New York Times has documented the first public record, Mr. Trump`s financial exaggerations came in 1976. Mr. Trump just few years at a college, boasted to a Times reporter he was already worth more than $200 million.

Years later, it emerge in the public filing that his 1976 taxable income had been only $24,594. A former reporter for the Forbes 400, the magazine`s annual ranking of America`s richest people says that back in 1984, Trump called him while posing as his alter ego John Barron to argue the magazine`s valuation of Trump`s wealth at $200 million wrong. ""With all the home runs Trump was hitting in real estate, Barron told me, he should be called a billionaire.""

And a former senior editor of Forbes notes that Trump used to endlessly lobby and occasionally bully the staffers who assembled a list trying to get them to move his net worth number up. Because for Trump being seen as rich as in many ways just as important as actually being rich. He`s made a lot of money convincing people that he was incredibly wealthy and successful.

Remember that despite presiding over six chapter 11 bankruptcies, he made many millions of dollars pretending to be a successful businessman on The Apprentice. In fact, it`s the one thing he was sort of good at.

This year though, Trump`s ability to capitalize on his carefully nurture rich man image has taken a big hit. He just fell off the Forbes richest 400 list for the first time in 25 years. And he`s getting the cold shoulder from the business world. As a New York Times reports ""after decades of bankruptcies, loan defaults, business abuse, and commercial failures, not to mention a polarizing presidency that ended with a violent mob storming the Capitol, Donald Trump was shunned by much of corporate America.

So, what is a former president to do and nobody will do business with him, especially when he`s trying to launch a brand new social media platform he wants to monetize? Well, he just found a way to get incredible access to a huge pool of cash by using a shell company Work Around.

Here to help explain is Tim O`Brien, a senior columnist for Bloomberg opinion. One of the few people who has seen Trump`s financial records after Trump sued him for arguing Trump was worth about 10 times less than he claimed. Trump lost. And Tim O`Brien joins me now.

Tim, there`s -- so there`s a thing called a SPEC that we have to understand to understand what has happened. So, maybe just first walk me through that.

TIM O`BRIEN, SENIOR COLUMNIST, BLOOMBERG: Well, always remember, any time people with a lot of power, a lot of money, have an acronym that is inscrutable, it`s because they`re trying to hide something. Usually, that`s pretty -- either simple in concept and possibly scamming in an outcome.

A SPEC is an acronym for a special purpose acquisition company. All it is a way of raising money without having to do a lot of disclosure. Historically, Wall Street has taken companies public on the premise that they are inviting outside investors to give them money to fund their operations. In exchange, they`re providing transparency, an operating history that would suggest the kind of expertise that merits giving them your money, as well as some demonstrable financial outcomes in their financial statements, a proven financial track record as well.

The IPO process initial public offerings are traditionally the way that small, unknown companies go public, again with the idea that they have to go through a rigorous vetting process before they come to you, the investor because they have bonafides in their operations and in their finances that make them investment worthy.

[20:25:10]

Then along comes the SPEC several years ago. It`s a -- it`s a new name for an old thing on Wall Street. These used to be called reverse mergers. All they are essentially is a way for a company to become public and raise money from public investors without having to go through all those other steps of disclosure, showing what kind of operating success you`ve had, showing that you`ve actually been profitable over a period of time, again, making you visibly trustworthy to get someone else`s money.

It is no accident that SPECs have attracted people who don`t want to go through that, because they`re looking for a workaround.

HAYES: Right.

O`BRIEN: And their track record this year has been bad. They haven`t -- you know, they have not performed well. They typically have big initial bursts. And then over time when that when they have to actually prove their mettle, they can`t do it. And their returns have not been -- they`ve been subpar.

HAYES: So, you`ve got this -- so this SPEC thing is -- the way -- my understanding is something called blank check companies where the company goes public, you don`t know what the company is, it`s just a -- it`s a vehicle basically.

O`BRIEN: It just says -- it just says we want to do something. At some point in time, give us money. And within two years, we`ll do that. And if we can`t, we`ll give you your money back.

HAYES: And so, in this case, you`ve got -- you`ve got a SPEC that has now going to merge with the Trump entities. The SPEC is out there, it has shareholders, it`s listed. It`s a blank check company. And the big announcement is that basically it`s going to do a deal with Trump. Is that right?

O`BRIEN: That`s right. But here`s the thing. The idea is, you know, when you give your money to a SPEC, to begin with, they have no operating history, they have no financials. When they finally say we have a company when the stuff inside that is investment worthy, it should have an operating history and it should have financials.

HAYES: Right.

O`BRIEN: And is Trump bringing that to the table? No, the fact that they filed was hilarious. It had pictures of Trump giving a trophy to a sumo wrestler. It had all of this marketing high jinks in it and nothing that would say oh, he`s actually--

HAYES: Right, because it`s not --

O`BRIEN: Go ahead.

HAYES: They`re not actually merging with an extant business. It`s not like there`s this vehicle and they go out and they`re like, hey, there`s this great mattress maker we found. They make these great mattresses and we can give them capital and expand their operations and return the money to you. It`s like, it`s a dream. It`s a -- it`s a marketing deck of like a future multifaceted Trump Corporation basically.

O`BRIEN: Yes. It`s suspiciously crummy asset management or a scam is what they actually should call it. And, and this is -- this is part and parcel of Trump`s whole history. When people say Trump`s been a good businessman, what they -- what they`re not actually defining is that he is an indefatigable and tireless self-promoter. And he`ll do anything to get his name out there. And he`s done a very good job of convincing people that somewhere behind that sizzle is steak.

The reality is he`s a serial bankruptcy artists time. And again, anytime he`s been asked to actually put his hands onto a company and manage it well over a long period of time, he screws it up time and again, for decades. And as you know and I know, running media company is not easy. And if he`s actually going to use this money to start successful social media platform or some sort of the news site is going to require good management, hard work, and imagination. And he lacks all three of those things.

HAYES: Yes. We should say that the stock went up on this sort of frenzy like sort of buy the rumor sell the deal kind of thing. Like, oh, it`s going to happen. But again, the proof of the pudding --

O`BRIEN: But again, that`s been consistent with SPECs all year. It`s consistent with IPOs. People love the buzz in the beginning and then it`s once the haze goes away, and you say, well, what have you done for me lately? Can you really run a company? Oh, you can`t, and then it tanks.

HAYES: I guess you`ve -- I guess if you really want to make the bet, here you could just, you know, try to find some way to short this and see what (INAUDIBLE)

O`BRIEN: I think you and I should pool -- let`s pool our money, Chris, and short it together.

HAYES: I don`t think I`m allowed to do that.

(CROSSTALK)

HAYES: I think correctly, I`m not allowed to do that for standards reasons.

O`BRIEN: I`m not either. I`m not either.

HAYES: But just -- and I don`t get that stock tips, but I`m just saying, a short position is a thing that exists out there for people that think a certain entity is not going to return a lot of money. Tim O`Brien, thank you very much.

O`BRIEN: Thanks, Chris.

HAYES: Up next, a major player in Trump`s failed coup attempt is going to testify to Congress. And we`re going to talk to a member of that committee who will question him right after this.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[20:33:36]

REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): If you get subpoenaed by a court or by Congress to come down and testify, you think you might have a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination to invoke at some point, you take all of the questions starting with what is your name, what is your address and so on.

When you get to a question where you think you might incriminate yourself as to a bank robbery or an insurrection or whatever it might be, you say, I take the Fifth Amendment. I assert my privilege.

At that point, the committee has an option. Will the committee just accept that or will the committee say we will give you some immunity which means you`ve got to testify, but we will guarantee that nothing that you testify about will be used against you.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST: The select committee investigating January 6 has been very clear that they are not messing around. If you refuse to come and testify willingly, they will come after you.

And it`s barely even been 24 hours since the House voted to hold Steve Bannon in contempt for refusing to testify asking the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution over his refusal to cooperate. And now it seems another key witness has been shaken loose.

Tonight, CNN is reporting that a former Department of Justice official Jeffrey Clark will testify before the committee a week from today.

Now, to reset the situation here, you may remember Clark was subpoenaed by the committee last week. He`s a lifelong Republican lawyer who served both in private practice and in the George W. Bush DOJ ultimately becoming Acting Assistant Attorney General for the DOJ`s Civil Division at the very tail end of Donald Trump`s term. And that`s a big job, that`s up there in the, you know, upper echelon in the department.

[20:35:07]

Once Trump lost the election, Clark, that gentleman you see there, became one of the leading voices if not the leading voice as far as we can tell, pushing the Department of Justice to aid Trump`s attempt to overturn the election. He even reportedly plotted with Trump himself to take acting Attorney General`s Jeffrey Rosen`s job.

Clark met with Trump personally after the election and urged the DOJ leadership to intervene in the Georgia election. In fact, providing a letter ready for the Attorney General`s signature.

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse emphasize just how important Clark is to the investigation earlier this month.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

(CROSSTALK)

SEN. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE (D-RI): He`s the person of interest, he`s the -- he`s the central person in this saga. And at some point, in the committee before a grand jury someplace, his testimony is going to be obtained.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: Congresswoman Elaine Luria Democratic Virginia is a member of the select committee investigating January 6th, and she joins me now.

Congresswoman, I guess first I just want to ask if you`re in a position to confirm this, that Mr. Clark will be testifying before the committee a week from today?

REP. ELAINE LURIA (D-VA): Well, as you know, we`ve issued a subpoena for Mr. Clark`s testimony, but as far as when and if particular witnesses testify, I`m not going to comment specifically on that.

But you know, as Senator Whitehouse said, as the subpoena indicates, he`s definitely a person of interest, who we think has information that`s important for this investigation.

HAYES: There`s a question now about the what happens next on the Bannon situation, which is the vote came out, there`s a referral to the Department of Justice. What is your expectation about the timeline here?

LURIA: Well, I`d say that, you know, we didn`t waste any time after the timeline ran out on the subpoena. Within a week, we voted, we`ve referred that from the committee to the full House floor as you saw the vote happened yesterday, and the speaker confirmed that.

And you know, that was taken over to the Department of Justice applicably within hours. And you know, we expect that to move forward quickly.

You know, we`re not messing around here. You know, this is not the previous administration. With this investigation, specifically into the violent acts of January 6 with an attempt to stall the certification of the election results.

This is important and we are not going to allow people to defy the subpoenas from Congress, it`s essential that we get information from them. And you know, I fully expect that the Justice Department will evaluate all the facts in the case. And you know, I`m hopeful that they will move with speed on acting on the criminal contempt referral that we`ve sent to them.

HAYES: There was also some news today suggesting a fairly accelerated pace for briefing and hearing arguments in the lawsuit the former president has filed to attempt to stop the National Archives from turning over those materials that are being sought.

I`m curious if you`re encouraged by the pace there because it does seem to me that a big question is whether the courts drag their feet or not, whether the courts understand the importance of reaching decisions on these evidentiary issues quickly or not?

LURIA: What I would say is that the indication with the timeline that we were given today is that they fully understand that. They understand the importance of this investigation and obviously, the Judiciary is independent branch of government. And they will evaluate all of these facts and move accordingly.

But every indication I have today is that they are moving with utmost speed to address these issues and make sure that, you know, any cases brought before them that impact the work of the committee will be handled quickly and without delay.

HAYES: Another key figure in this drama, as far as we know from public reporting and actually, just, you know, public appearances is the law professor John Eastman who authored that. And I have a very interesting interview with him in the National Review in which he attempts I think to kind of wriggle out from under the sort of shameful weight of what he authored.

He says he disagrees with some major points in the two-page memo. So, anybody who thinks that`s a viable strategy is crazy. He told the National Review about part of it.

I wonder if you anticipate Eastman being someone that you would be possibly interested in speaking to at some point as well?

LURIA: You know, we are certainly interested in everyone who has information about the events leading up to January 6, the big lie and sort of where that came from, and this, you know, plot to pressure the vice president to change the results and choose different electors.

So, you know, I think anyone who`s familiar with the events surrounding this would understand that, you know, those memos, you know, everything that he stated in that interview with the National Review is something that, you know, is of utmost interest to the committee in this investigation.

[20:40:03]

And, you know, I did read that article and you know, did find that he kind of tried to backstep on things that he actually admitted in writing, so I found that quite interesting.

HAYES: I did too, that was also my interest -- my reaction. Congresswoman Elaine Luria, thank you very much.

Still to come, Senator Mitt Romney says he opposes Joe Biden`s big bill because one trillion seconds ago, Neanderthals walked the earth? A little confusing. We`ll explain it for you and the senator in just a bit.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: America is kind of like a big family that tore itself apart during the Civil War. And in order to make peace, we told ourselves a certain story about it. And for a long time, we had trouble telling the difference between that story and the truth.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: For years, we have covered dozens of different stories about this divided country from people rallying to keep the Confederate flag at the South Carolina Capitol to the white supremacists chanting Jews will not replace us as they marched to protect Confederate statues, to people protesting the teaching of critical race theory in America`s history of racism.

[20:45:13]

A new documentary from executive producers Brad Pitt and Henry Louis Gates, Jr. called ""CIVIL WAR"" examines the roots of the divisions in the U.S. tracing them back more than 150 years to the Civil War.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We`ve never really had a racial reckoning. The problems started first immediately after the war. If you want north and south to get together and get along again, you don`t talk about causes and consequences, you talk about the mutual valor on that battlefield.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When we look at southerners and how they try to twist the narrative of what happened, I want us to put ourselves in their shoes and look at why.

If you can teach empathy when it comes to history, it is such a powerful thing for the rest of your lives.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No one on the civilian side on the Confederate presidency was ever forced to concede and repudiate what they believed and we allowed a group of people that waged an armed insurrection against the government to build statues to their heroes, so that has kept it alive. We have never solved the core problem of the Civil War.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: The Peacock original film ""CIVIL WAR"" offers an intimate look at our race, heritage, tradition, geography shape, our beliefs, and the different ways Americans portray the story of our Civil War, as well as the stories that we refuse to tell.

Tune in Sunday 10:00 p.m. Eastern on MSNBC.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[20:50:41]

HAYES: Democrats are in control of Washington, which means right on cue, it is time for Republicans to start caring about the deficit again.

The Biden administration is currently negotiating with Senate Democrats over the cost of spending bill which is expected to contain provisions addressing everything from health care and child care, to education and climate change.

Republicans are not too happy about the idea of the government spending money, at least in this particular case. Spending money to materially improve the lives of regular people in the country.

Just listen to Senator Mitt Romney outline his concerns.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): So, you may be hearing about the presidents` social spending bill in Washington. The amount of money he wants to spend is really an astronomical amount of money.

Just to give you some perspective, a million seconds ago, a million seconds ago was just earlier this month. A billion seconds ago, George Herbert Walker Bush was president. A trillion seconds ago, Neanderthals were on the earth. A trillion seconds ago, a trillion is an extraordinarily large number.

So, whatever number the Democrats come up with one, two, or 3.5 trillion, it`s a heck of a lot of money on social spending.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: Terrific. Listen, communicating large numbers is hard, I know this firsthand. But telling someone how long a trillion seconds is or expecting them to know or care exactly how long ago the Neanderthals walk the earth.

I mean, Mitt, what if I told you that if you go -- that if -- that if you go back one second for every dollar in the annual military budget, you`d arrive at the year of the cave bear went extinct over 700 billion seconds ago?

You know what you`d say if I told you that? You`d say, what the hell are you talking about? See how useless that is for a tool for explaining government spending?

First of all, the money being proposed here will be spent over the next 10 years, not all at once. Romney leaves that out of his Jurassic Park math, because really that`s in line with and often less than what he and fellow Republicans are happy to spend on other things.

Let`s break it down for you, Mitt, say one dinosaur equals $1 trillion. While the details are still being negotiated, let`s also say for the sake of argument, the cost of the Democrats spending will be $1.5 trillion over 10 years. That would be less than the $1.9 trillion cost the Trump tax cuts over the same period of time.

And every single Senate Republicans supported those tax breaks primarily for the rich and for corporations, so it`s less. And that $1.5 trillion price tag from the Democrats that senators seem so worried about is equal to what we`re about to spend on national defense in just two years, in two years, just the Pentagon budget.

If you project that defense spending out over the same 10-year window, well, golly, that`s a heck of a lot of dinosaurs.

Robert Reich served as Secretary of Labor under President Bill Clinton. He`s also the author of The System: Who Rigged It, How We Fix It. And Betsey Stevenson served on President Barack Obama`s Council of Economic Advisers and as chief economist to the Labor Department in the Obama administration.

Let me first start with this big picture here, Robert, the big numbers around budgets are essentially meaningless to everyone.

I mean, no one actually can get their heads around them. I work with this all the time and a trillion is like meaningless to me whether you tell me it was Neanderthals or whatever.

I think the goal is always to scare people with big numbers, but I`m not quite sure if it works. What do you think, Robert?

ROBERT REICH, FOMER SECRETARY OF LABOR UNDER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON: Well, unfortunately, it`s working a little bit this time around, because remember, the original number was going to be 3.5 trillion, that was Biden`s opening. And now, it`s getting squeezed down to the range of maybe 1.5 to two trillion.

I think that these numbers only have meaning in comparison with other things that we are trying to do. Now, you compare it to national defense over the next 10 years, eight trillion. Now, compare two trillion to eight trillion, right? (INAUDIBLE) you don`t have to be an advanced mathematician to see that.

If you look at the amount of trillions of dollars that the Trump Republican tax cuts represented, that was two trillion right there, Chris.

And finally, if you`re looking at how much billionaires, the 775 billionaires in America actually how much they gained over the course of the pandemic, over the last year and a half, just in terms of their fortunes? 775 people, and that was $2.1 trillion right there.

I mean, compared to everything else, the numbers that Joe Biden is talking about for fundamental, fundamental things. I mean, childcare and Medicare, help for seniors, for vision and for hearing, for all kinds of other things, basic needs of America. Well, it`s more important, excuse me for saying so that another 85 F-35 bombers.

HAYES: The other way to think about this, Betsey, and the way I`ve been thinking about it is even with at the large, the $3.5 trillion and these numbers, it`s essentially like a very small increase over 10 years of total U.S. outlays to basically expand fundamental aspects of the American social safety net for eldercare, childcare, Paid Family Leave, dental care for seniors in ways that are not, you know, that other countries tend to have and we don`t. And as a price tag, it`s like an appreciably small amount of the total amount of spending.

BETSEY STEVENSON, FORMER MEMBER, PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA`S COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS: Also, I would agree with that, let me give you another way to scale it. You know, we passed Social Security in 1935 when our GDP was 20 times or 20 -- our GDP today is 20 times bigger than it was in 1935.

Yet in 1935, we said we`re too rich of a country to let our senior starve and it`s now 2021, and I`m telling you, we`re too rich of a country to let our children starve.

So, what -- you know, some of the important things that are in this bill are ensuring that we reduce child poverty through expanding the Child Tax Credit, and then making sure that families can make ends meet through basic safety net provisions and social supports that other developed countries have, as you said, like Paid Family Leave access to affordable childcare.

HAYES: So, here`s a big question I want to get you both your takes on this. As we`ve watched the negotiations, you got a bunch of stuff that was in that first initial package $3.5 trillion. Basically, Manchin and Sinema, just the two of them alone have basically, hacking and hacking and hacking.

There`s a question about how do you get down from 3-1/2 to 1-1/2? One way is you choose a smaller number of programs, but you do them full tilt, and you make them permanent for the full budget window. And the other is you keep all the programs, then you pair them all back in different ways?

Right now, the keep as many programs as you can and pair them back. So, instead of 12 weeks of family leave, you get four weeks, and instead of the Child Tax Credit being extended for 10 years, you get extended one year.

That`s the approach that`s being taken. There are some people think this is the wrong approach, Robert, and then Betsey, tell me what you think?

REICH: Well, Chris, having been in and around politics for the past 40 years, I can tell you, it`s better to try to get as much in as you possibly can with a hope that people actually like what you`re doing politically, and therefore we`ll put pressure on politicians to extend it.

That is the political rule. That`s how we have done a lot of things. And I suggest that Congress do exactly the same.

HAYES: So, you`re on board with that and that`s interesting as someone who`s a veteran of some of this stuff. Betsey, what do you think?

STEVENSON: You know, I think one of the things that frustrated me about this whole debate is we have focused on what`s the dollar amount, instead of what`s the value, and what are we getting.

And so, I think that it`s most important that we make the investments for children early on, so that we`re expanding that Child Tax Credit that we`re making the investments in the early childhood education, universal preschool.

Because, you know, those lay a foundation that allows our system to work better reducing equality -- inequality going forward, allowing kids to grow up and be able to be more productive as adults pay more into the tax system. And we actually know from decades of studies that at the end of the day, we end up raising more tax revenue from investing in kids.

So, those are investments that pay. I really want to see a lot of the emphasis there. But you know, I hear the argument that, you know, we got to give people a taste of things.

I have to admit makes me cry a little bit to hear four weeks of paid leave. But you know, I guess we got to get a paid leave system going, and then hopefully people will like it and they`ll ask for more.

(CROSSTALK)

REICH: I`m sorry, if I can -- if I can just suggest, I think that what the Republicans and also Sinema and Manchin, what they would like more than anything else is for Democrats to squabble about all this.

To say, oh, well, if you don`t do environment, I mean, it`s environment versus kids or it`s this versus this. I mean, in fact, we don`t have to make these decisions, should not make these decisions. If we can afford it. We are the richest country in the world, every other country is doing this.

[21:00:05]

HAYES: Pakistan has 12 weeks I think of leave. I just saw that today. Robert Reich and Betsey Stevenson, thank you both.

That is ALL IN for this week. ""THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW"" starts right now. Good evening, Rachel."
2021-10-22,The ReidOut,MSNBC,Tiffany Cross,"And good evening to everyone at home. I`m Tiffany Cross in tonight for Joy Reid and we`ve got a lot to get into in the next hour, including stunning new details about what happened in the hours before that deadly shooting on a movie set in New Mexico.

And in a little while, I`ll be speaking to Congressman Jamie Raskin about the vote to hold Steve Bannon in contempt and that bizarre scene on the House floor yesterday when Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene literally tried to pick a fight with both Raskin and Liz Cheney. Yes, we`re going to talk about it.

But we begin THE REIDOUT with progress that will impact millions of working class Americans. Now, it sounds like Democrats are finally getting close to the finish line when it comes to delivering the build back better agenda, but the questions we all need answers to, what exactly will be in there and will it include what was promised?

Now, Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to the boogie down today. She was in the Bronx with families in part to promote administration`s plans.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: This right now is a moment that will not last. It is a particular moment of incredible opportunity and a moment to transform our nation. In this moment, we have an opportunity to build an economy that works for working families.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CROSS: And last night, President Biden seemed to appear hopeful that it would actually get done. Take a listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: We`re down to four or five issues, which I`m not going to negotiate on national television, as you might guess.

ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: We would be interesting in hearing it if you want.

BIDEN: I know. But all kidding aside, I think we can get there.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CROSS: But there are two major hurdles that Democrats have to overcome, and that is West Virginia Senator, I love the filibuster, Joe Mansion and Arizona Senator, nobody know what she wants, Kyrsten Sinema.

Now, in order to ensure that both remain on board in passing this once in a lifetime legislation, the White House and fellow Democrats have to trim their proposal from $3.5 trillion to somewhere around $2 trillion.

So, here is where we stand on the legislation and what exactly it means to you. Now, according to NBC News, the bill currently include a year extension to the child tax credit, four weeks of paid family leave, that`s down from 12 weeks, universal pre-K, vouchers for dental cost, funding for child care centers and increase in Pell Grants to help pay for college, elder care provisions and some type of climate change funding.

Now, let`s talk about what is probably out. That`s free community college, expanded Medicare, a more aggressive climate change proposal and, thanks to Sinema, no increased corporate tax hikes to help pay for this bill. And additionally, The Washington Post is reporting that the bill will most likely include a smaller investment in housing and homelessness.

But in a promising sign, it does seem like Democrats are finally looking to finalize the plan that would tax 700 of the wealthiest Americans as a source of spending for the legislation. House Democrats will aim to take up the legislation, which would give Americans more but in smaller amounts instead of hardier investments into fewer things by October 31st. As you know, that`s Halloween. Let`s pray it`s not a doomsday.

I`m joined by Dr. Jason Johnson Professor of Politics and Journalism at Morgan State University and Host of one of my favorite podcasts, A Word with Jason Johnson, and my friend, Fernand Amandi, Democratic Pollster and MSNBC Political Analyst. This should be an exciting discussion for sure.

Jason, you have the benefit of being onset with me, also the added benefit of being my nemesis, so I`ll start with you. Look, Democrats have to get something done and we`re going in the midterms. People of color, younger voters, they came out in droves to deliver the power of the federal government to Democrats. What`s their message going in 2022 if this is what the bill looks like, and can they even get it passed?

JASON JOHNSON, MSNBC POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR: So, here`s the thing Tiff. I know that sports is your strong suit.

CROSS: Absolutely. Thank you.

JOHNSON: So this is an example. We talk about young people and young voters and everything else like that, they are looking past this game towards the second one. These infrastructure bills, the build back better plan, all those things are great and wonderful, but a lot of activists on the ground are like, okay, if you do this, what happens to voting rights? Because the fact to matter is these negotiations are setting the frame work for how we think we`ll have to negotiate whether or not we`ll have the right to turn out and vote to thank them for punish them for not getting these policies through afterwards.

[19:05:01]

So that`s what I`m sort of paying attention to now. It looks like they`re about to land the plane here. They`ll eventually get some sort of policy through but they`ve got to then immediately move to voting rights. If that is put on the back burner until 2022, there will be chaos next fall.

CROSS: Yes. And can they even keep the power to the federal government if that`s move to the backburner. And that a good point, Fernand, so I want to bring you in the conversation here. What is the message that Democrats should be carrying if it`s 2022, and like I just made the point to Jason, can they keep the power of the federal government?

FERNAND AMANDI, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, Tiffany, they are going to have to do it around what I think is a central component that really has been lost thus far, and the Democrats have to be seen as the party that took control of a nation in chaos around COVID and was able to right the economic (INAUDIBLE) and help solve the COVID crisis.

Now, a lot of work was actually done as a preliminary step with the American rescue plan. Remember, the vaccine rollout that we`ve seen now on getting close to 70 percent, we`re about to see it fund 28 million children in this country. That is critical. But that economic recovery and the sense that COVID is being fixed by the Democrats, if the Democrats aren`t perceived as having gotten credit for that, they are going to have a hard time selling anything.

And I think to Dr. Johnson`s point, it can`t be said enough, A, they`ve got to get this reconciliation and this infrastructure bill passed. They`re in desperate need of a win now because there is this question of competence. And if they get that done before the Virginia election, which is right around the corner, it would be disastrous, Tiffany. If they don`t get it passed before then there is a loss in Virginia and all of a sudden, whatever momentum is halted, so it`s critical that they get this done.

And then as Jason said, save democracy. This open assault on the democratic process that is happening before our eyes by a GOP that is now unhinged and unhinged from the tenets of American democracy, if they don`t address, there may not be a 2024 to defend the case that the Democrats fixed the country in 2020, 2022 and beyond.

CROSS: Yes. Fernand, you raise a really good point but honestly, I think a lot of people watching at home, if you don`t cover this stuff, you don`t want to get in the minutia of like Capitol Hill drama. It`s really about what is in this bill that impacts you.

So, I want to talk a little bit about housing because Congresswoman Maxine Waters said she`d fight for it. I want you to take a listen. I had her on the show a few weeks ago. Take a listen to her response and then we`ll talk about housing on the other side.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): If there is going to be a real effort to deal with the discrimination and the exclusion of people of color and people who are working every day but can`t afford to have rent, then we have got to spend the money in order to deal with the housing crisis in America.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CROSS: Look, Jason, I`ll tell you right here in D.C., there are a lot of people who are homeless. The population of homelessness keeps increasing. There are millions of people facing homelessness or eviction. That is a frightening feeling. This money in this bill will give money for down payment assistance. I mean, it really impacts everyday American people. If this goes or if it shrinks --

JOHNSON: So here`s the thing. You can`t kick people on the streets in the middle of a pandemic that comes from people, you know breathing and being around each other. So this has to be taken care.

This is part of the messaging that I think Democrats should using against Sinema, against Manchin. If you look at -- you know, you can do back of the envelope math here, right? If you look at the Trump tax cuts and you look at the Bush tax cuts, you add those up together, that`s about $3.6 trillion in tax cuts. This whole plan by the Democrats is only going to come in at about $2 trillion. It`s actually a discount. It`s going to be keeping people in their homes, providing people with the resources that they need and helping kids go to school. They should be putting this in contrast to the cheapskates in Congress right now who are saying, we can give money back to the billionaires but we can`t give it to you to keep your house.

CROSS: Right, exactly. And, look, let`s talk about Sinema. You know, this is driving me quite insane. Fernand, I want your opinion here because Biden said yesterday during the Town Hall, she`s smart as the devil. Yes, my friend, on that we agree. Why is she concerned about corporate tax hikes and the wealthiest people in this country more than she is American people? It just feels like she`s a plant.

Look, the Republicans have a vested interest in this administration not getting anything accomplished. She seems to be somebody who is hell bent on this administration not getting anything accomplished. What are your thoughts here?

AMANDI: You know, trying to understand Krysten Sinema is like trying to understand Rudy Giuliani. I mean you figure out because I can`t. I mean, at this point, all I concern about is getting her vote on the line, the yes that matters to get this bill passed.

And, fundamentally, it`s not really going to be about Krysten Sinema, it`s not even going to be about Joe Manchin. It`s can the Democratic put it across the finish line.

One other quick point on this, you know, I think another potential land mine is if the Democrats don`t celebrate the passage, whether it`s a $2 trillion bill or $3.5 trillion as a success.

[19:10:00]

You wanted a new car for Christmas, you didn`t get the Lamborghini Diablo, you got the tricked out Cadillac. It`s just as good and it`s going to save and help the lives of millions of Americans. But until people begin to feel that, and that still may be a year away from when the bill passes until people start to feel the effects real time, I`m not sure it`s going to have that political benefit. And that`s why it`s important that it has to be framed around the case of this is being done to fix the country`s problems economically with COVID and then in the future, the Democrats are the party that are enhancing every American`s quality of life.

CROSS: Well, yes, I echo your thoughts, Fernand. Look, I think Sinema is going to have some trouble when it comes to midterms when she`s up for re- election. She may have a challenger. What are your thoughts on her being an obstructionist to this scale?

JOHNSON: Well, Joy -- she`s going to be in trouble because her state is unhappy with her. And the thing you can`t do as a politician you can sellout to the rich, you can offend people. You can`t look like you`re not doing your job. Where is Kyrsten Sinema, like Waldo and Carmen San Diego are easier to find. She`s also here, she`s making wine (ph). So, she doesn`t look like she`s doing her job. So, it`s not just being abstractionist. That`s Joe Manchin. At least he says he believe or something. She`s just not there.

So, I think it`s going to be easy to eventually bring her along once she sells out to the people who are paying her bills but her long-term political future in the Democratic Party is next to nil. And she`s not going to be a Republican because she would have no power there.

CROSS: Yes. I got three words for you, Congressman Ruben Gallego. There is an effort to draft him to run and challenge her. And when you look at her record here on helping the build back better plan, it is very dismal.

Fernand, let me ask you because there are other things in the bill that I think we don`t talk enough about. Again, people get so caught up in a minutia of Capitol Hill. I think it`s important for viewers to understand the benefits that are in this bill that will impact them.

There is a provision in the bill that would authorize $5 million a year for the small business administration for an entrepreneurial program for formally incarcerated individuals. That is a major piece of legislation that we`re not really talking enough about or paying enough attention to. This will impact a ton of people particularly people focused on ban the box legislation when they can`t get a job anywhere else.

These are the talking points that Democrats need to be out there selling. Do you think that the media and Democrats have done a good enough job of selling this to make sure that this bill gets passed?

AMANDI: Well, no, I don`t think they have. But by the same token, Tiffany, I think strategically, it doesn`t make sense to sell it until it passes. We already know the polls are clear, the American people think these individual policies are very popular. They want to see these types of legislation that are going to make the country move forward and be (INAUDIBLE) until real progress.

The problem is, right now, the reason we`ve seen President Biden`s approval kind of blow up over the summer is this seeming sense that nothing is getting done. The infighting, the sausage-making, folks don`t really go into the minutia. Once it`s passed, however, that changes the dynamic because then you can say, look at this transformational piece of legislation that the Democrats, not the Republicans, because there is not going to be a single Republican vote on most of these items that the Democrats passed, and if it were not for the Democrats, this would not be happening.

But back to the point, get it done, get it passed and hopefully, all indications are, it looks like, it might happen this coming week.

CROSS: Yes, we hope so. And we got to get off that talking point of infighting among Democrats. We going to put the blame back on Republicans who are being obstructionists here. So, thank you so much Dr. Jason Johnson and Fernand Amandi.

But don`t go anywhere at home because up next on THE REIDOUT, the feeble and embarrassing Republican opposition to holding Steve Bannon in contempt of Congress. Congressman Jamie Raskin, a member of the January 6th select committee, will join me next.

Plus, new information tonight in the tragic shooting death on the set of an Alec Baldwin movie with crew members reportedly very concerned about safety, and this was before the shooting actually happened. So, you don`t want to miss that.

Also, seriously, where is the accountability? The stunning report about a Miami police officer who still has a job despite years of complaints and hundreds of thousands of dollars in lawsuit settlements.

And with voting rights legislation facing major road blocks, we just talked a little bit about that, facing major road blocks in Congress, President Biden may be re-evaluating his position on the filibuster. Sometimes prayers are answered.

THE REIDOUT continues right after this.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[19:15:00]

CROSS: All right. In a bipartisan vote yesterday, the U.S. House of Representative referred Steve Bannon to the Department of Justice for charges of criminal contempt. Now, during the debate on the measure, we learned that Republican Congressman Jim Banks is apparently still bitter that he wasn`t appointed as member to the select committee investigating January 6th.

Now, you guys may remember, Banks was summarily rejected by Speaker Pelosi back in July. So, it must have been especially humiliating for him when his GOP colleague, Congresswoman Liz Cheney, revealed that he has been pretending to be a member ever since. Cheney devolves that Banks has written letters to federal agency falsely describing himself as the ranking member of a committee that he literally has no part of.

Now, Banks, of course, was among the 202 Republicans who voted to let Steve Bannon defy a congressional subpoena and yet, none of those Republicans could articulate a legitimate argument in opposition to the measure. Instead, we heard a litany of incoherent complaints and I`m not even kidding you guys, some were not even on the subject. Take a listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. JIM BANKS (R-IN): The select committee despises Steve Bannon`s politics so they`re abusing their power to put him in jail.

REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): These are the folks who assaulted our democracy for two years under the specter of the Russia hoax.

REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): When President Trump was president, Americans got Christmas presents on time.

GAETZ: And because they can`t build back better, they have just decided to build back meaner.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CROSS: It always comes back to a war on Christmas some kind of way.

Now, listen, Marjorie Taylor Greene was apparently so enraged that Congress would dare hold Bannon accountable that she tried to pick a fight with Liz Cheney and Jamie Raskin on the House floor while the vote was taking place.

Now, according to Axios, Congresswoman QAnon reportedly called the vote on contempt a joke. In turn, Cheney responded that Greene was a joke and asked whether she needed to be focusing on her anti-Semitic space lasers. She was referring to, of course, that conspiracy theory that Greene had posted to Facebook in 2018.

This woman`s a member of Congress, by the way.

Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a member of the January 6 select committee, joins me now.

Congressman, so happy to have you here on a Friday night. Thank you for being with us.

And I`m really sorry what happened yesterday, I really -- can you tell our viewers what exactly happened when you were confronted by someone who clearly seems a bit disturbed?

REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Well, but I have never met Marjorie Taylor Greene. I have never been properly introduced to her. And she began by approaching me and asking when we were going to have hearings about the violence in the Black Lives Matter protests.

And I said, we really did need to have a hearing about Kyle Rittenhouse and the two protesters that he shot and killed with his assault weapon. And so she turned to Liz Cheney, and then began engaging with her about something.

And, well, I was impressed by the fact that Liz, who is about the best- mannered, most poised member of Congress we have got, gave as good as she got from Marjorie Taylor Greene and was not letting her get away with anything.

CROSS: Well...

RASKIN: So I appreciated the fact that Liz stood up for our position.

CROSS: Well, you both did. I think that was a pretty quick comeback on your part.

Listen, I mean, we can kind of laugh at this because she`s laughable, but it`s kind of scary that she sounds like the homeless woman who sleeps on my block, right? And this is a woman who is actually an elected member of Congress, that it feels a bit unsafe. Like, she keeps asking for these encounters.

But I don`t want to spend too much time on her.

RASKIN: Well, look...

CROSS: Oh, go right ahead. Go right ahead.

RASKIN: Yes.

Well, no, I will just say there is a serious issue here, because Donald Trump has taken over the GOP and they have organized themselves literally around a lie, a lie that`s been rejected in 61 federal and state courts all the way up to the Supreme Court, a lie that was rejected by numerous election officials, including lots of Republicans, like Brad Raffensperger, the secretary of state of Georgia, and a lie that`s even been repudiated by their own concocted commissions that they create, like in Arizona, somehow to try to ferret out the fraud.

And it`s never there. In fact, in Arizona, they found that Biden had an even bigger victory than was legally declared. And yet still they organize themselves around the big lie. And then that turned into the big violence. And now it`s turning into the big cover-up with Steve Bannon, who refuses to do what every other American has got to do, which is to testify when called upon to testify by your Congress or by a court.

CROSS: Yes.

And, look, I think that`s the scary part that you talked about, the big lie. It`s not so much that members of Congress are perpetuating this. It`s the millions of people who believe this. And it`s got to be scary going in the midterms, because will these people ever accept an outcome of an election that they don`t like?

I want to ask, because I think the question people want to know overwhelmingly is, will any of these people ever face accountability? If Steve Bannon gets away with thumbing his nose at a congressional subpoena, I mean, there`s got to be other subpoenas in the work. You think about Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, all the other people, Congressman Mo Brooks even.

If he gets away with thumbing his nose at a subpoena, what does that mean for your committee`s work?

RASKIN: Well, before we get there, the good news is that the vast majority of people we have called up for interviews or that we have subpoenaed have either come to testify in interview or are engaged in good-faith negotiations with the committee.

I mean, if you get a subpoena from the U.S. Congress for Friday at 9:00, and you can`t make it, and you say you want to come Monday at 4:00 or reschedule for some valid reason, we can do that. We`re not trying to put people in jail. We`re just trying to get the information we have been commanded to do by statute about the worst attack on the U.S. Capitol since the War of 1812, a political attack that really could have kicked off a civil war.

In fact, I looked at hundreds of tweets today that were sent out calling this civil war part two or locked and loaded, people who were ready to come to Washington to do violence to the Capitol, to threaten Vice President Mike Pence, and to try to overthrow the election.

CROSS: Listen, I want to tell you I was among the people. I was actually walking into our bureau when that attack happened on our Capitol.

[19:25:05]

And these people were coordinated, Congressman. I mean, they had on T- shirts. They were color-coordinated. They had hats. I understand the committee has broken up its work into five committees, and that there is one specific forensic financial person who is looking into the financing of what happened there.

What are you looking -- what information are you looking to gain with this forensic financial expert who`s looking at the financing of this attack?

RASKIN: I`m not aware of that reporting.

The select committee, we meet as a whole. There might be some reference to different groups of people on the staff perhaps, but don`t believe everything you read about the January 6 committee.

But in any event, we are very interested in the coordination among the different violent elements. We know that the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, the 3 Percenters, the Aryan Nations, the militiamen, the QAnon followers all acted as a violent vanguard at the front of the march and helped to lead the violence, which led to the wounding and injury of more than 140 police officers, who were beaten over the head with the steel pipes and Confederate Battle Flags and two-by-fours and so on.

And then, of course, there was coordinated entry into the building and they were chanting, ""Hang Mike Pence, hang Mike Pence,"" and threatened to go and get Nancy Pelosi and put a frigging bullet in her brain, as one of the insurrectionists said.

So this was very serious business. Donald Trump`s efforts to play this off as a rowdy protest, where the protesters were hugging and kissing the officers, is just a farce...

CROSS: Yes.

RASKIN: ... and a further extension of his big lie.

CROSS: So, I just want to nail you down on this. Has the committee brought on financial -- a forensic financial litigator to look into the finances of the incident that happened on January 6?

RASKIN: I`m not aware of that specifically. Obviously, a number of us, including me, are very interested in the financing of it.

You don`t knock over the U.S. Congress and disrupt Electoral College counting for the first time in American history by accident, and you don`t do it for free. I mean, this is a very expensive operation, bringing in the buses and bringing in the protester, rioters by planes, trains and automobiles, the hotels, the motels, and the operation.

We`re going to see that there was millions of dollars, I think, involved in this operation when all is said and done. And we want to know exactly how the violent insurrection part was coordinated with the attempted political coup.

In other words, the violence that was mobilized against our officers and against other officials inside the building, how that was coordinated with Donald Trump`s attempt to get Mike Pence, for the first time in American history, to declare unlawful powers to reject Electoral College votes, lowering Joe Biden`s total below 270, kicking the whole contest into the House of Representatives for a contingent election, where, of course, we would vote not one member, one vote, but one state one vote.

That was the whole purpose of this thing. And the GOP had 27 states, although I don`t think they would have gotten Wyoming`s Liz Cheney, who is the at-larger up there, but it still would have left them with 26 states in the majority. And I think that that was the purpose of the political coup and also the purpose of the violent insurrection.

CROSS: Well, Congressman, I`m sure you have heard many times by now that old phrase that, what do you call a failed coup? Practice.

So we will definitely be watching the work of your committee as we enter midterms, as people -- we hope that people will believe in the democratic system that we have and accept the election results, even when they don`t like them.

So thank you so much, Congressman Jamie Raskin, for being here on a Friday night.

And up next: new information tonight about safety concerns before that deadly shooting on a New Mexico movie set involving Alec Baldwin.

We will be right back after the break.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[19:33:19]

CROSS: So many questions remain over the tragedy that unfolded yesterday on a film set in New Mexico.

During production of his new movie, actor Alec Baldwin fired a prop gun that killed the director of photography, Halyna Hutchins, and injured the film`s director.

NBC`s Miguel Almaguer has more.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MIGUEL ALMAGUER, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Shortly after the fatal shooting, a distressed Alec Baldwin outside the sheriff`s department in Santa Fe. Investigators say the veteran actor fired a prop gun on his New Mexico movie set Thursday, killing the film`s director of photography and seriously injuring the director.

911 OPERATOR: So, was it loaded with a real bullet or...

(CROSSTALK)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We don`t -- I don`t -- I cannot tell you that.

911 OPERATOR: OK.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have two injuries.

ALMAGUER: But just hours before the deadly shooting on the set of ""Rust,"" an independent movie in which Baldwin is also one of the producers, NBC News has learned several crew members walked off the set over safety concerns, including multiple previous misfires of the prop gun, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Baldwin, who is 63, expressing remorse: ""There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins, a wife, mother and deeply admired colleague of ours. I`m fully cooperating with the police investigation to address how this tragedy occurred.""

LARRY ZANOFF, HOLLYWOOD WEAPONS EXPERT: One of the things about firearms on set that people don`t realize is that, even if it`s set up the fire blanks, federally, it`s still a real gun.

ALMAGUER: Larry Zanoff, a Hollywood weapons expert who was not on the set of ""Rust,"" says when strict safety guidelines are followed, accidents should never happen.

[19:35:00]

The industry safety bulletin spells out: ""Blanks can kill. Treat all firearms as though they`re loaded. Live ammunition is never to be used. No one shall be issued a firearm until he or she is trained.""

Tonight, it`s still unclear if Hutchins was killed by a blank, live round or other projectile.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The way we handle firearms and the blank ammunition on set, that seems very difficult to imagine how a blank would do that.

ALMAGUER: In 1993, after Brandon Lee, the son of Bruce Lee, was killed in a filming accident involving a prop gun, industry safety measures tightened.

ALICIA HAVERLAND, PROP MASTER: To my mind, this accident happens because somebody missed some check that they should have done.

ALMAGUER: Hutchins, who was 42 and posted photos of horseback riding near the set, was quickly becoming a Hollywood star.

""Rust"" actress Frances Fisher posting this tribute, saying: ""Rest in paradise, dear Halyna.""

Tonight, a tragic accident and now mounting questions as to how something like this could ever happen.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

ALMAGUER: The production company involved in this incident says they are not aware of any safety concerns, but add they are fully cooperating with investigators -- Tiffany.

CROSS: All right, NBC`s Miguel Almaguer, thank you so much.

And still ahead on THE REIDOUT: Ever wonder how police officers with dozens of citizens complaints against them actually stay on the job? Well, meet Miami Police Captain Javier Ortiz, who a fellow officer described as a bad cop protected by bad leaders.

What history tells us about police accountability -- after the break.

Stay right there.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[19:41:01]

CROSS: The very long road to police reform was dealt another blow this week, when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of two police officers` qualified immunity defense against allegations of excessive force.

Now, this sends a clear signal that a majority of this conservative court is still overwhelmingly in favor of providing this controversial shield for law enforcement. And this comes one month after bipartisan police reform talks in Congress collapsed. And this is partially over the issue of qualified immunity.

So, without the ability to hold police truly accountable, we are seriously left with some truly heinous and violent actors who time and again abuse the badge they wear without any repercussions.

Now. Politico`s Marc Caputo took an in-depth look at one such officer in Florida who was described as Miami`s least fireable man. Captain Javier Ortiz, who is also the union president of the Fraternal Order of Police in South Florida, has packed up numerous headlines over allegations of excessive force, false arrest, racist social media posts and bullying.

And, as Caputo reports, in his 17 years on the job, 49 people have complained about Ortiz to internal affairs. He`s amassed 19 official use of force incidents and accrued $600,000 in lawsuit settlements. And throughout all of this, he remains on the force with no more than a paid suspension to show for it. Some might call that a vacation.

Ortiz did not comment on the Politico story, but one of his lawyers describes him as a man of deep integrity who adheres to an older code of no-nonsense lawmen.

We know exactly what that means.

Joining me now is Marc Caputo, senior writer for Politico.

Marc, I`m so glad you`re here. And let me say bravo, my friend. This was amazing reporting. It`s very comprehensive. It was like reading a mini- novel.

Looking at this guy`s offenses, it is disgusting to read. Do you think anything is going to change now that your article is out?

MARC CAPUTO, POLITICO: Well, things started to change during my reporting -- and I`m not the only one who`s reported about Javier Ortiz -- is, there`s a new chief in town or new acting chief, and he made sure to put Ortiz on, as you said, a suspension. It`s paid suspension.

But they can`t suspend him without pay under state law. But one of the things that makes Javier Ortiz worthy of study in the context of today`s discussion and debate about police reform is, he kind of embodies all of the different elements. His record is so long and in-depth concerning police allegations of abuse, misconduct, bullying, and the like, is, we have state law.

We have a law enforcement officers bill of rights, which gives law enforcement officers a lot of job protection. You have at the local level...

CROSS: That`s what I`m...

CAPUTO: Yes.

You have at the local level a collective bargaining agreement. You have the fact that he was also a union boss for a number of years. And so there were these intersecting of policy and political matters that made it very difficult for him to be fired.

Now, even his own lawyer in our story said that the Miami-Dade -- or, better said, the Miami Police Department`s internal affairs division has been a joke for 40 years. And that`s been a big problem as well. And you teased this episode or this segment by talking about one of the quotes from one of his fellow officers, Jermaine Douglas, who`s a lieutenant, who said that he`s a bad cop protected by bad leaders.

The other problem is, a lot of leaders just haven`t really had the stomach to take him on. But the new chief, Morales, the acting chief, seems to be willing to do that, albeit his suspension appears to be for his conduct involving other officers, potentially creating a hostile work environment.

It`s not concerning his interactions and the accusations made against him by citizens on the job.

CROSS: So, in your great reporting, you talk about the acting chief, this guy Manny Morales.

Now, even if Morales fire him, there are still provisions in this contract that would potentially challenge that firing and protects him. I just want to give our viewers an idea of who this guy harassed, because although he`s done these racist posts, He clearly is not discriminatory when it comes to who he`s harassed.

[19:45:06]

These are just some of the people who have complained about him, a teacher, a college student, bar patrons, motorists, a maintenance worker installing electrical lines, a drone operator, a woman who claimed she was flung down an escalator outside a bar. A man lost his nerves from having handcuffs tightly -- he reportedly had -- another man had his eye socket cracked in a beatdown that Ortiz did.

So, I ask you, Marc, if there are still provisions that if Morales fires this guy, he could still wind up back on the force, if the courts will not do anything about police reform, if Congress will not do anything about police reform, what`s the recourse for people who are on the receiving end of this level of abuse?

CAPUTO: Yes, that`s a great question.

I would say let the process play out. I don`t have the ability to predict that. Now, if past is prologue, he`s probably going to get this job back. However, ultimately, a firing of a police officer under the union`s collective bargaining agreement goes to an arbitrator, a quasi-judge, who rules kind of yea or nay.

One of the concerns that a lot of the former chiefs and perhaps the current chief -- I haven`t talked to him about this -- have is that the arbitrator is picked in part in concert with the union. And the arbitrator will have a tendency to give the city a few firings now and then and then he will give the union or the cop a firing now and then -- or, better said, will reinstate him now and then.

It`s kind of like a 50/50 proposition. Now, that having been said, one of the interesting things about Ortiz is, while he was the former union chief for the Miami Police Department, he has since had a big falling out with a membership when they decided not to reelect him or to elect him again as president.

But he`s now trying to get another union involved. So there might not be a lot of love for the union for him anymore. Certainly, a lot of the rank and file don`t like the direction that he`s gone, and they don`t like the appearance or the reputation that the Miami Police Department has gotten.

Now, that having been said, as my story says, the Miami Police Department has a real history of brutality. The FOP, the Fraternal Order of Police local chapter, is named after Walter Headley. He was the chief, the racist chief in Miami who, in 1967, famously said, ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts.""

CROSS: Right.

CAPUTO: And that`s something that Donald Trump repeated word for word a few years later, or just last year during the post-George Floyd uprisings that we saw across the nation.

CROSS: Yes.

And even though the unions have rejected this guy, they -- I will not shed a tear for the unions. The police unions are a huge part of police brutality. And, honestly, Marc the $600,000 that it`s cost taxpayers for bad cops -- when people complained about where their tax dollars go, start with bad cops.

Listen, bravo, Marc Caputo. Amazing reporting. I encourage everybody to check out your story in Politico. It was riveting. Thank you so much, Marc, for joining us on a Friday. And go have a wonderful weekend.

Up next: a major development today in the almost total abortion ban in Texas.

Plus: the fight for voting rights. Greg Abbott picks an actual advocate for the big lie. No kidding. This guy`s going to oversee elections in Texas, and as President Biden shifts his position on the filibuster, to boot.

We will be right back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[19:52:23]

CROSS: The U.S. Supreme Court is allowing Texas to remain America`s version of ""The Handmaid`s Tale"" for now, but they have agreed to hear a case relating to its law effectively banning all abortions in the state. So the justices will hear oral arguments on November 1.

That`s just 10 days from now, but they have declined to block the law for a second time. Only Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented on that, and blasted her colleagues, writing: ""The promise of future adjudications offers cold comfort, however, for Texas women seeking abortion care who are entitled to relief now.""

I`m joined now by Dr. Christina Greer, professor of political science at Fordham University, and Matthew Dowd, Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor of Texas and the founder of Country Over Party.

Chrissy, I got to start with you here. Are we seriously going to trust a conservative court with an actual handmaid on it to protect the woman`s right to choose?

CHRISTINA GREER, FORDHAM UNIVERSITY: No, we can`t. And so that goes not just with the Supreme Court, but state courts all across the country.

And I think, honestly, Tif, this just highlights the real importance for us to really pay attention to local elections, to pay attention to statehouse elections, and to pay attention to statewide elections, because so many of these people leave the statehouse and they go to Washington, D.C., and they make decisions based on our bodies and our lives.

But, obviously, we`re seeing this play out in the great state of Texas. And, sadly, what I really want people to think about are the elections that are happening on November 2, so making sure that you call your friends in Virginia to make sure that they`re voting, because we don`t need Virginia to turn into Texas.

And in the upcoming years, we don`t want more states to roll back not just a woman`s right to choose. But, obviously, that goes hand in hand with voting rights legislation as well.

CROSS: And more states are actively trying. The Supreme Court will also hear that Mississippi case when it comes to abortion rights as well.

Matt, I want to ask you because you`re running in the state of Texas. Chrissy says, yes, pay attention to those statehouse -- those state legislatures. But you can pay attention. If voter suppression is keeping you from the ballot box, what can you do beyond paying attention?

The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, just appointed as secretary of state a lawyer who briefly joined Trump`s challenge to the 2020 election results in Pennsylvania. Honestly, with this level of voter suppression happening in Texas, what impact will that have on the elections? And can you win when the state is actively suppressing the right to vote?

MATTHEW DOWD (D), TEXAS LIEUTENANT GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I mean, Texas has become the epicenter of all the awful, I mean, absolutely all the awful, from everything from choice to guns to not dealing with fundamental issues to now voting rights in this.

[19:55:02]

And it`s because these politicians don`t feel like they`re going to be held accountable in a general election. And their goal -- and it`s their unstated goal, but it`s very clear -- is they don`t want Election Day to look like Texas. That`s what their goal is, because Election Day looked like Texas, they would all lose and they know that.

So it`s their desire not to be held accountable for all these awful policies. Yes, we can win. Yes, it`s going to take a turnout to overcome impediments. We have done it in our history before. We thought we were over this 50 years ago or 80 years ago or 30 years ago. But we`re returning to a time when we had voters back then and 50 years ago who were beaten and were killed along the way fighting for voters rights.

We`re not honoring their legacy. We`re dismissing their legacy in this moment of time. But yes, we can win, but it`s going to take extra, extra effort and extra work. And the worst thing we can do is to sort of abdicate it.

I think part of the Republican strategy is to do so many bad things and so much that we feel so beaten down that we give up. And I think that`s part of their unstated strategy, because people are so -- with this onslaught. But we have to overcome impediments, just like all those leaders before us overcame impediments in their time.

CROSS: Yes.

And, look, Matt, I totally take your point. I hear you.

But, Chrissy, I have to say we never thought voter suppression was over, because even though the Supreme Court struck down Section 5, voter suppression ran rampant in all our communities. When you see those long lines on Election Day wrapped around buildings, that`s voter suppression.

When you saw increased voter I.D. laws, that was voter suppression. So can we just admit that Republicans do not want people who look like you and me at the ballot box? This is targeted suppression for black, brown indigenous people to keep them out of the ballot box. It`s like they`re spitting in our face, trying to convince us it`s raining.

GREER: Absolutely.

I mean, we have we have been having the demographics is destiny in conversation. We also know that the Democratic Party`s become the party of the bigger tent, right? They`re welcoming to immigrants, to people of color, to people of multiple classes, whereas Republicans have decided to cast their lot with white supremacy.

And so that slowly, but surely makes their pool a much smaller pool. They also don`t believe in science or facts. And so, obviously, with COVID-19, they`re losing a large percent of their base as well. And so voter suppression is a way for them to win races. It`s the only way they can win, in many ways, by cheating.

We saw it in Georgia in 2018 with Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp, and then we have seen it subsequently in races across the country. I think, though, what we should remember from our lieutenant governor candidate is to say, even though we are exhausted -- and we know that black women have been the backbone of not just the Democratic Party, but democracy writ large -- we must keep going, because this, as you said, Tif, is not new.

So, we do have new strategies. We have to actually try and stay one or two steps ahead, whether that`s fund-raising, whether that`s calling people in other states to make sure that they even know that races exist. We know that even, in presidential elections, only 60 percent of the voting eligible population bothers to show up.

CROSS: Yes.

GREER: So we still need to tap into people who are sitting on the sidelines who we actually need at the ballot box.

CROSS: Yes, that`s a good point. We`re not new to this fight. We`re true to this fight.

So, Matt, you just heard Chrissy`s point.

Let`s assume that President Biden might be tuning into this program tonight. He did tease that he might be willing to nix the filibuster. If he`s watching right now, what advice would you give him when it comes to the filibuster?

DOWD: My advice is abandon the filibuster yesterday. And if you can`t go back in time, abandon it today.

The filibuster is being used to undermine democracy in our state. I actually thought we should have done voter rights before anything else, because it`s the most fundamental thing.

CROSS: Yes.

DOWD: Infrastructure is great. And, fine, and we need it. But everything else depends on voting rights. Every single other issue depends on voting rights.

It should have been the priority. And until that was done, we should have put everything else off until that was done.

CROSS: Very good point.

Matt, we will be watching your race. Good luck to you.

DOWD: Thank you.

CROSS: I hope you are -- I hope I`m talking to the next lieutenant governor of Texas.

And thank you, Dr. Chrissy Greer. You will be with me tomorrow on ""THE CROSS CONNECTION."" So I will see you then.

And, you guys, time flies. That`s THE REIDOUT for this evening.

But, before we go, I want to tell you why I`m here. It`s because Joy is off celebrating her son`s birthday. I want to wish a happy birthday DeJoy son Miles Nasir Reid. Yes, he is named after Nasir Jones, the rapper, because Joy`s has been loved him that much. I don`t know if I have permission to tell that story. But I did.

Don`t hate me, Joy.

All right, but, tomorrow, coming up on ""THE CROSS CONNECTION,"" I`m going to talk to Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, and we`re going to talk about getting that reconciliation bill passed, despite major concessions progressives had to make.

And as jury selection gets under way in the murder trial of three white men for the death of Ahmaud Arbery, we will do a deep dive on the process of how people of color are often kept out of the jury pool. You don`t want to miss this discussion.

So join me tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. for ""THE CROSS CONNECTION"" right here on MSNBC.

But ""ALL IN WITH CHRIS HAYES"" starts right now."
2021-10-21,Tucker Carlson Tonight,Fox News,Tucker Carlson,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT, cheerful in spite of it all.

We have spent an awful lot of time telling you what we think about the Biden administration, we do it virtually every night -- a little repetitive.

So tonight for once, we are going to let the Biden administration speak for itself. This show has obtained some recently shot footage of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the President and Vice President of the United States or vice versa, depending on your view. Footage that shows them in their private moments, deep within the Federal compound in Washington.

It is a remarkable window into who these people really are and maybe the most remarkable thing about it is that this video comes from the Biden administration itself. They released it apparently on purpose. They wanted you to see it. They thought you would be impressed. They thought it would make them look good.

Keep that in mind as you watch this first clip. This footage is from Kamala Harris's quote ""surprise birthday party"" the other day. Here it is.

[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]

CARLSON: In the entire history of sad parties, that has got to take first place. Talk about a mirth-free event. It's like a room full of aliens have gathered to act out this concept they just heard about called happiness.

The head alien is a supernaturally strange being called Kamala Harris, who for reasons no one ever explains walks into a room in the most secure building in the world with a piece of elasticized fabric over her face like that's totally normal, just another masked birthday celebration.

This Kamala Harris then walks over to a man press reports claim is her husband, who like her is fully vaxxed. He for some reason has a mask on his face, too, which suggests that they don't actually live together or indeed have ever met.

We don't know the truth, but whatever it is, the two then proceed to pantomime the most sexless imitation of a kiss imaginable, awkwardly rubbing faces through the gauze.

And then, as if it could get weirder, Harris suddenly yells ""Surprise"" at her own surprise birthday party, like she is hosting the event for one of her multiple personalities.

What the hell is going on here? Who are these people? Oh, just our leaders, the people who run the country.

And then it gets truly bizarre. Take a look at this video, again, intentionally released by the White House press office of Joe Biden in a hallway. He totters along like a nursing home patient in the final stretch, clearly, unaware of his surroundings or what he is carrying in his own hands. Spoiler alert, they are flowers. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Really? Oh, Joe. Oh, I'm very touched. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, look at how gorgeous.

This is my favorite.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Got it. Thank you.

HARRIS: Oh, I'm going to hang this up with great pride. Thank you, Mr. President.

JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You're welcome.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: The camera catches her, masked alone in her own office, and then she talks, ""Oh Joe, I'm very touched,"" says this alien posing as Vice President. She goes on to use the word ""gorgeous,"" a word that no actual human being has used since 1977.

There's even if you listen for it, a fake kiss sound in there. We're assuming Harris made that sound though it's possible they're playing some sort of soundtrack in the background. Lifelike party sounds volume one. We can't be certain.

What we do know is that they wanted you to see this and that is interesting. You can tell a lot about a regime by the propaganda it produces.

North Korea puts out a ton of propaganda. Just the other day Kim's government released a video of its soldiers breaking concrete slabs with their bare hands. One particularly committed communist lies down shirtless on shards of broken glass.

So the message here is not hard to understand. These are the people defending North Korea, back off or we'll eat you. Okay. Got it.

But what's the message of the Joe and Kamala videos? All your nightmares are real? The people in charge are even worse than you thought they were?

Kamala may have seemed kind of fake to you. Joe may have looked a little out of it, but actually the White House is now telling us, you don't know the half of it.

It's possible Kamala Harris is an actual robot with batteries. The new frontier of AI. Joe Biden isn't just punchy, he is barely conscious. That's the message they're sending. It's really strange, and it's been going on for a while.

Remember last year when Joe Biden read from a note card that Kamala Harris would be his Vice President. This was the announcement video they released.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HARRIS: Hi, hi, hi. Sorry to keep you.

JOE BIDEN (D), THEN CANDIDATE F OR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: That's all right. You ready to go to work?

HARRIS: Oh my God. I'm so ready to go to work.

BIDEN: First of all, is the answer yes?

HARRIS: The answer is absolutely yes, Joe, and I am ready to work. I am ready to do this with you, for you -- I -- I just -- I'm just deeply honored and I'm very excited.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Whoa. That's just beyond belief. So why would the people around Joe Biden want the public to see something like that? Maybe they don't care. Maybe they're not embarrassed of Joe Biden's condition. Maybe in fact his condition was the whole point of making him the Democratic nominee for President in the first place.

That's not unimaginable, it's happened. There's precedent for it.

In 1617, a group of unscrupulous political operatives in Istanbul installed a mentally defective man as sultan of the entire Ottoman Empire. His name was Mustafa I. Historians later referred to him as Mustafa, the Mad, and he certainly was that. Mustafa spent his days babbling like an infant and throwing coins to birds.

Occasionally, if he was feeling sporty, he would knock the turban off someone else's head. He was completely demented.

The general population didn't know that, of course, the Sultan rarely left the palace and when he did, he spoke from a script. But the people around him certainly knew, they preferred him that way. He was easier to control.

Whatever you think of him, Joe Biden is definitely easy to control. You'll recall this clip in which Biden kept referring to something called the Harris-Biden administration.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The Harris-Biden administration is going to relaunch that effort and keep pushing further to make it easier for military spouses and veterans to find meaningful careers.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Again, these are prepared remarks. We can't say that enough.

These are statements that the Biden people are making voluntarily. So many of them are like that. They are not gaffes. They're what they want you to see.

In December of last year, Kamala Harris who grew up in Canada, a foreign country, swore that she witnessed quote ""multiple generations"" of her family celebrating Kwanzaa, an American Holiday that was invented in Long Beach, California after Kamala Harris was born.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HARRIS: My sister and I, we grew up celebrating Kwanzaa. Every year, our family would -- and our extended family, we would gather around across multiple generations and we tell stories. The kids would sit on the carpet and the elders would sit in chairs.

So to everyone who is celebrating, Happy Kwanzaa, from our family to yours.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Our family. That's just crazy that they would put something like that out. Not one word is true, but not one word is believable. Again, it was a prepared statement it was carefully considered. They didn't even bother to look at a calendar. It was like when Kamala Harris said that Tupac was the best rapper alive 23 years after he died.

When you're making history, you don't care about chronology or facts. We've never had a Vice President who looks like Kamala Harris, so words no longer matter. That's the real message. All that matters is what Kamala Harris looks like. She's our Martin Luther King.

In 1965, the actual Martin Luther King told the story about a Civil Rights march in Birmingham, Alabama and at that march, a police officer asked a young girl who was present, ""What do you want?"" In King's telling, quote: ""The little girl looked at him straight in the eye and answered, 'Fee- dom.'"" That was 1965.

Here is Kamala Harris's version of the same story, this time starring Martin Luther King's modern reincarnation, Kamala Harris.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HARRIS: She would tell the story about how they are marching -- and this is back when strollers didn't really have arm rest and seat belts.

[LAUGHTER]

HARRIS: So they're marching away and you know shouting and all of that and then I think it was my Uncle Freddie, you know looked down and looked in the stroller, which was empty.

[LAUGHTER]

HARRIS: And said ""Where's Kamala?"" And apparently, they left me like a block behind. I'd fallen out the stroller.

[LAUGHTER]

HARRIS: There you go, and then my mother would tell a funny story about how like one day she did -- and I was fussing and you know and so I'm fussing and fussing. She -- it's much cuter when she would tell the story, but she'd say -- so then she would look down at me, and ""Kamala, what do you want? What do you want?"" And I looked back up and I said ""Fweedom.""

[LAUGHTER]

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Wow, ladies and gentlemen, that's our Martin Luther King, the Canadian version, except without the wisdom, the insight, the restraint, or the eloquence but with a brand new highly creepy engineered laugh, a noise that according to zoologists, scares the hell out of squirrels and other small woodland creatures.

But maybe you like it, maybe you want to hear a whole lot more terrifyingly cringey fake laughter from a highly ambitious lady with dead eyes. The White House is betting that you do, so to accommodate your bottomless appetite for being patronized by Kamala Harris, they released this video, in which she talks about space.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HARRIS: I just love the idea of exploring the unknown and then there's other things that we just haven't figured out or discovered yet. To think about so much that's out there that we still have to learn, like I love that. I love that.

And so, I'm very excited about the Space Council.

You guys are going to see -- you're going to literally see the craters on the moon with your own eyes.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh my goodness.

HARRIS: With your own eyes, I'm telling you, it is going to be unbelievable.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: I'm telling you, oh, okay. It's funny, you imagine often that the truth is hidden away. We'll never really get to what the truth is, but in fact, very often the truth is right there. It's right on the video, just look at the video. That's the truth.

It's the truth they want you to see anyway and for that reason, it is deeply revealing. That video tells you everything.

One of those kids listening to Kamala Harris talk about space, we later learned, was a child actor and yet, he was still the most genuine person in that video. It's kind of nuts when you think about it.

These people literally have no idea how absurd they look, and how could they? They live in a tiny airless cult where everyone pretends that Joe Biden is fully competent and Kamala Harris is a Civil Rights hero. It's Jonestown.

The clips we displayed are the documentary evidence that historians of the future will study to figure out what happened to America.

Behind the heavily guarded walls of the White House, everyone has gone crazy. Just this week, the Biden administration declared that a biological man who wears a dress is now a female admiral, and then they sent that brave four-star female admiral out to deliver a speech that read like something out of a D-Day documentary. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ADMIRAL RACHEL L. LEVINE, ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR HEALTH FOR THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: I am truly honored to join the ranks of men and women across this great nation who have committed to defend the United States against small and large threats known and unknown.

I am honored to serve as the first female four-star officer of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Come on. They're daring you to sit there and not say this is ridiculous, but it is. Sorry, it is ridiculous. Sorry, not playing along. But they don't think it is, and so you have to ask yourself: How long will it be before Joe Biden points his horse to the Supreme Court? And when he inevitably does do that, you have to ask how long will it be until CNN informs us this is a watershed moment for equine rights. Don't you dare laugh that would be a hate crime.

Jesse Kelly will laugh. He is committed to laughing. He is host of ""The Jesse Kelly Show."" He joins us tonight.

Jesse, thanks so much for coming on. I appreciate it.

So why would they release videos of themselves that make them even less appealing than you thought they were?

JESSE KELLY, HOST, ""THE JESSE KELLY SHOW"": Because they don't know. They don't know Kamala Harris -- she is the real life version of -- there's an old communist story I'm sure you know it from the Soviet Union, Pavlik Morozov. That's some 13-year-old boy who turned in his father for denouncing the regime and then his family murdered him and he was this national hero for the Soviet Union, and it turned out they completely invented him.

Kamala Harris is the real life version of that. She is a complete blank slate who believes in nothing, she never has believed in anything, except advancing to the next top job and she is the real-life version. She is the blank slate. They can paint her whatever she wants.

It's because every part of the system is so corrupt now and rotted with this communist filth, they never get challenged, so they don't feel the need to even present a believable story. Who is going to challenge them, Tucker?

CARLSON: I mean, but of all the people you could pick, I mean this is someone who is so synthetic that she can't even settle on a pronunciation for her own first name. We have played video of her pronouncing it at least two different ways. Her own name.

So I mean, I don't know, a lot of politicians are phonies, most are, but they're not that phony. Why her? I mean, she is like an insult to the intelligence of every American.

KELLY: It is odd. I will tell you, she is actually one of the oddest politicians I've ever seen in my entire life because what you just said, most politicians are sociopaths and they lie about everything and they don't actually care. We all get that. But they at least have learned how to pretend, right?

You know the picture where they hug the little old lady or hold the baby as if they're not grossed out by this little gremlin they they've been handed at an event or something like that. But Kamala Harris can't do it. She can't make herself do it.

There is nothing real about her. And her and Joe, you brought it up earlier, they are such an odd couple anyway. They picked her because she's black and a woman and they were going to check as many woke boxes as they could. If only she had transitioned into being a woman from a man, then she would have been the ultimate candidate.

But what's Joe doing with Harris? I mean, he has half a brain and she is known for her brain.

CARLSON: It's just -- so, it's just so interesting. I mean, if somebody said to you, ""Jesse Kelly, you know we've got these really strict obviously racist criteria for picking someone. You have -- it has to be this color, this sex,"" you would have no problem finding someone a hundred times better than Kamala Harris even with those -- you know what I mean? Like what does it tell you about how they feel about African-American women that that's the one they picked?

KELLY: Well, Tucker, we are what -- 48 hours removed from the President of the United States comparing voter ID laws to Jim Crow again on national TV. These are not people -- these are not people capable of shame. We think about them as real human beings. That's a man or that's a woman or that's a President.

These people are not capable of that kind of shame. It's not in their nature. They are completely lost. They are sociopaths, all of them.

CARLSON: I've got to say and this is controversial, but I think I would rather watch Stacey Abrams on TV who I think is loathsome, but at least she is like a recognizable human being. I mean, she has written soft core pornography. She has a heart.

Kamala Harris, it's like, honestly, I'm watching AI in action. It's the future.

KELLY: Yes. I think they would disagree with you though because Stacey Abrams, yes, she is absolutely horrific in every possible way, but she does have actual thoughts. You can tell that's a human being who has thoughts and feelings and thoughts of her own.

Well remember, this is all Barack Obama's third term. That's why you have Susan Rice there. That's why you have every loser Barack Obama put into power there. They don't want a thinking human being. They want Kamala Harris they understand Kamala Harris is somebody who has worked very hard to gain her career in politics. She is not going to do anything now to lose it, she'll do what she's told, when she's told.

It is why when she takes over after they cart poor Joe out of the back eating Werther's Original, it'll be so much worse than Joe Biden.

CARLSON: It's such a smart point and we need to remind ourselves of that every day. This is Obama's third term and these people are picked because they're compliant and hollow. That's totally, absolutely right, I think.

Jesse Kelly, thanks so much for that insight, and the Werther's.

KELLY: See you. Bye.

CARLSON: So, as our infrastructure falls apart and our power grid flickers, you are lectured that you must make sacrifices. But the people lecturing you would never consider making those sacrifices in the push for green energy so-called. It is just the latest example of that.

The very same politicians telling you we need wind farms have done everything they can to keep those windmills out of their own neighborhoods because they're awful. We took a very close look at that double standard that is on display everywhere.

It's in a brand new episode of our long-form documentary series ""Tucker Carlson Originals."" Here is a part of it.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KEVON MARTIS, ANTI-WIND ACTIVIST: Well, the number one rule of wind development is this. It's the Starbucks rule which says, never try and site a wind project within 30 miles of a Starbucks coffee shop.

CARLSON (voice over): Kevon Martis lives in Michigan where he spends a lot of his time fighting industrial wind projects.

MARTIS: The demographic that's willing to pay a premium price for quality coffee is the same demographic that typically has the education and financial wherewithal to organize and resist irresponsible wind projects.

CARLSON (voice over): We met him at this windfarm in Southern Michigan, which by the way is a 31-minute drive from the nearest Starbucks.

MARTIS: People who look at some of these wind proposals figure out quickly that one of the reasons their community is being targeted is it is poor and they are perceived as being desperate for revenue. They just think we are a bunch of rubes and hicks out here.

CARLSON (voice over): Since the very first American windfarm started spinning in New Hampshire back in 1980, the most powerful supporters of so- called green energy have successfully prevented windfarms from being built near their homes.

TED KENNEDY, FORMER U.S. SENATOR: There is a strong consensus that global warming is being accelerated by the burning of fossil fuels.

CARLSON (voice over): When developers proposed a windfarm in Nantucket Sound that was within view of Ted Kennedy's Oceanside compound --

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This 130 wind turbines will be producing clean renewable energy.

CARLSON (voice over): Kennedy used his ample political power to crush the project.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: The episode is called ""Blown Away: The People versus Wind Power."" It is out now on foxnation.com. We think it is good.

So the administration has completely reordered the country with vaccine mandates, which have no scientific justification. At least one state is fighting back. That state is Florida. Gov. Ron DeSantis made a big announcement about that today. He joins after the break.

Also, what they plan to solve our supply chain crisis.

We'll be right back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CARLSON: Well, pretty much since the day Joe Biden got inaugurated, you've been hearing in the media every day that the State of Florida is a COVID hot spot. Virtually every person in the state has died of the coronavirus, but suddenly you're not hearing that anymore. Why is that? Well, because the numbers are too stark to deny.

In the last seven days, Florida has averaged fewer COVID cases per capita than virtually any other state in the United States. It ranks 48th out of 50. Now, the Governor of the state, Ron DeSantis has announced a special legislative session to ban COVID-19 related vaccine mandates not just by the state, but by businesses throughout the State of Florida.

The Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis joins us now.

Governor, thanks so much for coming on. So if you would, explain what this would mean and why you're doing it.

GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): Tucker, over -- more than anything, this is an individual choice. Your livelihood should not be dependent on whether you get a COVID shot, much less in the future if these mandates take hold, whether you get your yearly booster or booster every six months or whatever they're going to make you do. This is a personal decision.

Number two, what Biden is doing is unconstitutional and we have a responsibility as a state to fight back against Federal overreach, but then number three, this is not good for the economy. This is just bad policy. You have a lot of businesses that actually need people particularly in healthcare and what, you're going to give people walking papers in the middle of this?

So, I think it's bad all around and I think that yes, we're going to be doing litigation against the Biden administration, which is important, but we also need to do legislation to provide protections for folks in Florida.

And I'll tell you, Tucker, yes, Biden is doing mandates and I disagree with that. I think we all do, but there are businesses that are doing this on their own even apart from the mandates and these are employees of theirs that have been working throughout this whole pandemic and now they're being told you get, you walking papers. That is not a free choice.

You know, Tucker, we had a nurse today at our event. She has already had COVID and she is pregnant right now and so she says, I think this is something that I don't want to do. How is that something that you're going to deprive her of her right to make a living based on that very reasonable decision?

CARLSON: So the White House is very focused on you and on your state and this is the centerpiece of their domestic agenda, vaccine mandates. This is the whole thing. It's what they care about most.

So if you openly defy them, I mean, are you expecting them to hit back? Try to choke off Federal healthcare money to the state? Or do you expect some kind of confrontation with the Biden administration?

DESANTIS: Well, I'm sure they're going to do whatever they can. Tucker, over the summer, when we had delta hit, I started a monoclonal antibody program because people were being admitted to the hospital without getting early treatment. So since we put that program in, our daily admissions have gone down about 90 percent.

Well, as we were doing that, Biden tried to cut off the supply to Florida because this was working. And so I imagine, they are definitely going to do something to try to hit back, but at the end of the day, do you think people -- do you want to protect people's jobs or do you not? And I'm going to be on the side of protecting people's jobs and if Joe Biden wants to be on the side of causing people to lose their job, well then, we'll let him do that and we'll fight the good fight.

CARLSON: Yes, because he knows more about Medicine than nurses and doctors. This is lunacy.

So the supply chain crisis is a real crisis. I think, a year ago, it cost three grand to move a container from Asia to the East Coast of the United States. It is now 20 grand, so this is affecting every part of the U.S. economy. You say you have a solution or a part solution to this. What is it?

DESANTIS: So we have capacity at all of our ports. Remember, Tucker, they made a big deal about LA going to start doing 24/7. We always do 24/7 in Florida. We've got capacity, and all of our ports can offer these businesses good incentives if they reroute their ships.

We've already had some ships rerouted. We expect to have more, but if you're going to sit off the coast for days on end, you might as well just bring it to Florida. We've got great logistics on the ground that can get it to market and we're happy to be able to step up because there are empty shelves. This is driving inflation. This is going to cause shortages.

We already see shortages, it's going to affect the Christmas season, so I think Florida can be part of the solution here.

CARLSON: The more Florida acts like a country right now, I think the better for all of us, my personal view.

Governor Ron DeSantis, I appreciate you coming on. Thank you so much.

DESANTIS: Thank you.

CARLSON: So, Dave Chappelle does a comedy special, whether you liked it or not, super popular with most Americans, but protesters have now gathered outside Netflix headquarters demanding that that special be removed because the jokes aren't allowed anymore.

Is comedy possible in a country like that? That's next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CARLSON: Not so long ago, it was a feature of high school biology class that biological sex is biologically real. It's detectable at the DNA level. You are born with it. You don't get to choose it, just as you don't get to choose your height, or your eye color, your susceptibility to breast cancer, or a million other things. It's genetic. Genetics are real, maybe unfortunately, but it doesn't change the truth of it.

But now, that's hate speech.

In his new special, Dave Chappelle, the comedian explains what happens when you challenge this lunatic new orthodoxy.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DAVE CHAPPELLE, COMEDIAN: They cancel people that are more powerful than me. They canceled J.K. Rowling. My God. J.K. Rowling wrote all the ""Harry Potter"" books by herself. She sold so many books, the Bible worries about her.

[LAUGHTER]

CHAPPELLE: And they canceled her because she said in an interview -- and this is not exactly what she said -- but effectually she said, gender was a fact and then the trans-community got mad as [bleep], they started calling her a terf. I didn't even know [bleep] that was. But I know that trans- people make up words to win arguments.

[LAUGHTER]

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Well, that's the truest thing ever said, making up words to win arguments. You see that in a lot of places now. So none of that is particularly radical, it's pretty conventional really. Four years ago, no one would have noticed it.

But now, a number of Netflix employees have decided to protest the special. They want it pulled off of the service. Then they harassed a man who came to support Chappelle and freedom of speech. Watch this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

CROWD: Accountability.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When do we want it?

CROWD: Now.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What do we want?

CROWD: Accountability.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When do we want it?

CROWD: Now.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What do we want?

CROWD: Accountability.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When do we want it?

CROWD: Now.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's okay to laugh, but you're sparking a hate conversation.

CROWD: Trans-lives matter.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why are you breaking my sign? Why the [bleep] are you breaking my sign?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's got a weapon. He's got a weapon.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: So they break his sign, and then they accuse him, he is left holding only a stick, accuse him of having a weapon.

So his speech is violence, their violence is speech. See how that works?

What's interesting is that the number of people who really care about this, is issue enough to assault someone over is tiny, and yet they have disproportionate power, 350 million people in the country, maybe 1,100 feel that way, but they're running everything. Why is that?

Well, Seth Dillon might know the answer. He is the CEO of ""Babylon Bee,"" one of the very few remaining satire sites of the entire internet. He joins us tonight. Seth, thanks so much for coming on.

So, this stuff is in your face every single day. You're the target of a lot of this. You've got to wonder, the people trying to destroy your business and your life like, they are a tiny percentage of Americans, aren't they?

SETH DILLON, CEO, ""BABYLON BEE"": They are, but they wield all the power. This is the funny thing. You know, they really are the joke at this point because they try to project themselves as being marginalized. These are the marginalized. These are the oppressed.

CARLSON: Yes.

DILLON: But you can't make fun of them. You know, the way that you can tell who holds all the power in a society is by who you can't make fun of, right?

CARLSON: That's right.

DILLON: These are the people that you can't make fun of, so it's very clear, they hold all the institutional power in our culture and it is really interesting, you know, when you've got comedians like Chappelle, you've got to worry about now when you're telling jokes, not -- you don't just ask yourself, is this funny? You have to ask yourself, is this joke going to offend somebody who's more powerful than me, but identifies as being marginalized? Because I might lose my career.

CARLSON: So is that -- I mean, your site manages to be consistently funny and I think probably most of our viewers get, you know ""Babylon Bee"" headlines texted to them at least once a day. How big a concern is that for you? I mean, do you feel like you're right on the edge of getting your business taken away from you?

DILLON: Well, I mean that's the goal, right? There's like 10 different ways they are trying to attack comedy. One of them -- it's not even intentional. They are making reality absurd.

That whole opening you did with Kamala Harris and Joe Biden and all these videos and how fake they are, like it's impossible to satirize that. These people are beyond parody.

CARLSON: Yes, that's totally right.

DILLON: They've turned reality into a parody of itself, so that's one way. Then there's the intentional way. They fact check jokes, they try to rate them false, so they can get them taken down for misinformation. Then they try to accuse you of hate speech under the guise of satire or comedy like what they're doing with Chappelle and saying that his jokes are beyond the pale, they hurt people.

But really, it's the joke police. It's the people who are saying, oh, his jokes hurt my feelings. You know those are the people they deserve to be mocked more not less, because it's just silly to act like joke police, like jokes really are like violence, really, like you said earlier. You know, the speech is now violence and the violence is speech.

You know jokes are not violent. They don't hurt anybody.

If we're all equal, we should all be able to joke about each other indiscriminately and not have this like hierarchical structure where we have certain people who are off limits and we can't joke about them.

CARLSON: If we're all equal -- boy, you got right to the heart of it there. If we're all equal, only in a country where we're all considered equals can that happen, but we're not that country anymore. You're exactly right.

Seth Dillon, I appreciate your coming on and your site, which I love.

DILLON: Thank you. Thank you.

CARLSON: So we told you a couple of weeks ago that Attorney General Merrick Garland's family profited from the fascist order he put in place categorizing angry moms as al-Qaeda. We've learned a lot more about that. Garland's son-in-law profiting from racist theories taught to your children, we have the numbers on that, and they're astounding.

We'll be right back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CARLSON: Merrick Garland, the radical and now, we learn, corrupt Attorney General of the United States went to Capitol Hill today. He defended his memo, his obscene unprecedented memo calling on parents who are mad at school curriculums that their children are being forced to imbibe, calling those people terrorists.

At one point, Congressman Mike Johnson of Louisiana asked Garland about the company that his son-in-law runs. It's called Panorama Education. Panorama makes a ton of money pushing racist propaganda, the kind that parents are complaining about. That sounds like a conflict of interest, is it not?

Here is how Merrick Garland responded.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): Did you have the appropriate agency ethic official look into this? Did you seek guidance as the Federal regulation requires?

MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: This memorandum is aimed at violence and threats of violence.

JOHNSON: I understand that, but did you -- excuse me -- did you seek ethics counsel before you issued a letter that directly relates to the financial interest of your family, yes or no?

GARLAND: This memorandum does not relate to the financial interests of anyone. It is --

JOHNSON: I take that as a no.

Mr. Attorney General, will you commit to having the appropriate ethics designee review the case and make the results public?

GARLAND: This memorandum is aimed at violence and threats of violence.

JOHNSON: I understand your talking point. You're not answering my question.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: What a repulsive little sleaze ball that guy is. He sicced to the F.B.I. on people who criticized his family's business. He sicced the F.B.I. on people who criticize his family's business. That's what he did and he won't even admit it.

Asra Nomani is with the group Parents Defending Education. The group just released a woke consultant report card that reveals that Panorama Education received millions of dollars from public schools. Asra Nomani joins us tonight.

Thanks so much for coming on. So give us a sense of what this company does, Merrick Garland's family's company -- his daughter and son-in-law's company.

ASRA NOMANI, VICE PRESIDENT, PARENTS DEFENDING EDUCATION: Well, what's such a national scandal is that in fact, just as you said, Tucker, Merrick Garland went from being a top prosecutor to being a protector of this phenomena that we call woke industrial complex. Panorama Education is just one tip of the iceberg of this multi-million dollar industry.

What this company does is a screener. They call it a social and emotional screener. And what they are basically doing -- not basically -- what they are doing is data mining our children. They are asking children from Hawaii to Maine about their sexuality, their gender, and they're also asking these questions of their parents.

So what we did is we filed a Freedom of Information Act request across the country and we ended up quantifying $20 million of contracts from companies around the school systems and this is a scandal that everybody needs to pay attention to.

CARLSON: Wait a second. I mean -- if you -- if I walked up to a kid in -- a school kid in a public park and started asking sex questions, I get beaten with a two by four and arrested, rightly so. How do they get away with asking sex questions of other people's children?

NOMANI: Oh, it's just a scandal, Tucker. So what has happened is that Merrick Garland's son-in-law, a young man joined up with another young man at Yale University and they came up with this idea that they were going to do psychometrics on our students in order to improve their academics performance.

There is no evidence base that this actually is effective, but what has happened is it's become a Trojan horse. So you won't know this book, it's this critical race theory book. They say that it's taught in law schools, right, but somehow we now have this book called ""A is for Activists"" and what has happened is they use these surveys and they use these multi- million dollar contracts in order to bring in consultants that bring in the very divisive ideas of critical race theory, this thing called gender theory now, queer theory. And this is how they are radicalizing and indoctrinating our kids.

It is scandalous that our chief prosecutor for this country is now running interference for the woke industrial complex. It is really a national scandal.

CARLSON: It's beyond belief and with coordination from the National Association of School Boards. This whole thing is so corrupt, it's actually shocking.

Asra Nomani, I appreciate you coming on tonight, thank you.

NOMANI: Thank you so much, and we invite everybody to send us your tips to Parents Defending Education. We're looking forward to finding whatever is going on in your school district. Thank you.

CARLSON: Thank you for that.

Well, as you know, police across the country come under intense scrutiny anytime they shoot someone, even if it's justified. But when they shoot an unarmed person, there's an expectation we'll know exactly why.

But the D.O.J. has decided not to apply any scrutiny to the killing of Ashli Babbitt because she was an enemy of the regime. She is dead and the media are happy about it.

One member of Congress is not happy about it. He was there that day on January 6th. He joins us after the break.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CARLSON: Michael Byrd may be the single most reckless Capitol Hill police officer still in uniform. At one point, he left his loaded Glock in a public bathroom and somehow kept his job.

Then on January 6th, Byrd, without warning her apparently, shot and killed Ashli Babbitt despite the fact she was a tiny female and unarmed, but to the media, this is worth applauding because Ashli Babbitt they told us was in fact not a protester, but a trained assassin from the Air Force.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOY REID, MSNBC HOST: Ashli Babbitt who is a trained Air Force specialist, trained by our tax dollars, to kill. She was a military member. If she had gotten through that door, God knows what kind of harm she could have done.

REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): Ashli Babbitt is the woman that was leading the mob that was about to storm uh the House floor and she was shot by a brave officer who was the last line of defense for many Members of Congress and many of these members were the slowest or least mobile members because they were having the hardest time getting out.

If they had been overrun by that mob, people would have been killed.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: She was a specialist in the Air Force, her specialty, assassinating Members of Congress. This is completely insane. We would never apply the standard to anybody who wasn't supporting the Republican Party, let's just be honest.

Finally, some Members of Congress are asking very obvious questions about this.

Troy Nehls is a former police officer who represents the State of Texas in Congress and he recently wrote a very tough and smart letter to the Capitol Police Chief and to the Justice Department.

In one of those letters, he says this, quote: ""Based on my extensive law enforcement experience, I could see nothing that could possibly justify the lethal use of force against Miss Babbitt on January 6th. How can a negligent use of deadly force not infringe on an individual's Civil Rights?"" Good question.

We've also got a picture of Lieutenant Michael Byrd aiming his gun at this Congressman on January 6th. The congressman is the man in the blue shirt in the picture. He joins us now.

Congressman, thanks so much for coming on tonight.

REP. TROY NEHLS (R-TX): Good evening, Tucker. Thank you.

CARLSON: And thank you for doing this. You were right there, so will you just re-state the argument that you're effectively making to the Department of Justice as a former police officer?

NEHLS: Yes, I'm a former County Sheriff in Texas, served as a Sheriff for eight years and I've been in law enforcement for 30, so I do know a little bit about what I'm talking about, but you know this all started because Leader McCarthy asked me, he selected me to be one of his five picks to be on this Select Committee to look into January 6th.

Of course, that unraveled very quickly because Nancy Pelosi rejected us, but I did my due diligence. I spent an enormous amount of time examining the documents into January 6th, the Senate report which came back out in March of this year, and what I uncovered, what I discovered was really, really disturbing to me.

January 6th quite honestly, the American people need to realize, January 6th really should have never happened. The Intelligence was there. The leadership within the Capitol Police had all of the Intelligence and it should have never happened.

And then of course you look into it and you see what took place with the shooting with Ashli Babbitt and listen, when I was a Sheriff, I had officers, Deputies that have shot and killed people. I've had deputies shot and so, I have some experience dealing with investigations and use of force issues, and I haven't talked to an officer anywhere across the country that felt what Lieutenant Byrd did was justified. It wasn't. Tucker, it was murder.

CARLSON: And no one in the U.S. media essentially has said a word about it. It's as if, if you vote for the wrong person, it's okay to be shot to death for that.

NEHLS: Well, it's amazing, too on these investigations. You know, it took place January 6th. The Department of Justice already had their released -- their press release stated that they would not be seeking any criminal charges and that's April 14th. That's a very quick investigation.

CARLSON: Yes.

NEHLS: As a matter of fact, there is information out there that says by February already, they chose not to pursue any charges against Lieutenant Byrd, but I'll guarantee it, if that shooting would have taken place last summer in one of our large cities across the country during these riots, there would have been an indictment very quickly.

CARLSON: Instantly. You're not allowed to kill Americans because you don't like their political views.

Congressman, I appreciate your bravery on this. Thank you.

NEHLS: Thank you. God bless.

CARLSON: We have a couple of great documentaries coming on this exact topic. They are on FOX Nation.

We will see you soon. Have a great night."
2021-10-21,Ingraham Angle,Fox News,Laura Ingraham,"LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham and this is the INGRAHAM ANGLE back in Washington tonight. We're going to give you can't miss analysis of Biden's train wreck of a town hall on CNN. His meandering, incoherent thoughts and everything from the supply chain crisis to gas prices to China.

By the way, he defended vax mandates and somehow, somehow insisted that few are actually quitting their jobs or losing their jobs because of them. And, of course, that's despite broad evidence to the contrary. He has no clue if gas prices are going to come down anytime soon. And he's just been too busy to get down to the border. And, of course, Anderson Cooper played his normal fanboy self.

But first, in the late 1600s, Sir Isaac Newton observed that, for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. Well, who knew Newton's third law of motion would be so relevant for centuries later? I give you Ingraham's first law of consequences. For every rise in inflation, there's a roughly equal and opposite decline in Biden's poll numbers.

A new CNBC survey shows Biden's net approval rating has collapsed from plus three in July to negative 11 today, a nearly five fold drop. Now, just 41 percent of Americans approve of Biden's job performance. That's compared to 52 percent who disapprove. But that wasn't even the most shocking finding in that poll.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

STEVE LIESMAN, CNBC SENIOR ECONOMICS REPORTER: 46 percent say, they expect the economy to get worse in the next year. That is the worst level in the 13-year history of the poll. I expected to see negative numbers. I didn't expect to see some of the worst polling numbers that we've registered in the 13 years that I've been doing this.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

INGRAHAM: Wow! Now, we sounded the alarm on this months ago, we warned Biden, the Democrats, and the media that inflation was coming, and it would absolutely devastate our economy. But we were ignored. And now, Americans are watching in horror, as their incomes and savings get eroded by rising prices for food, clothing, shelter and energy.

In one California town, the price of regular gasoline hit and, I kid you not, 7.59 a gallon. It's 8.50 for premium. If Democrats weren't already worried about their prospects in 2022 and 2024, they should be now. But, of course, they can always count on their peons and the media to cover for them.

First, the Washington Post told us to lower our expectations. You spoiled people. Now, the lefty rag Vox is going even further declaring, ""It's time for Americans to buy less stuff. Instead of opting to order our Christmas presents early, perhaps now is the time to reconsider America's great shopping addiction."" Or maybe the Biden administration could actually take steps to unclog our ports.

To start, Biden could appoint and the Senate could confirm a Transportation Secretary who's actually, just call me crazy, qualified and not a total hack.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PETE BUTTGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION: There's no easy fix, there's no magic wand. But there are a lot of things we can do. As long as the pandemic continues, we're going to see all kinds of disruptions. The biggest thing we have to do still as a country, is put the pandemic behind us.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

INGRAHAM: Wally, where's the Beaver! Furthermore, Biden could relax regulations and cut any red tape that's contributing to the mess at our ports. Now, if EPA rules are actually keeping more trucks from hauling containers, they should be lifted. And then maybe we should examine if they're even necessary in the first place.

Now, Biden could also help alleviate the reported shortage of truckers and workers in general. We'll talk about this a little later when we talk about what happened tonight at that town hall. But he could back off his divisive and anti-science vax mandate. Didn't do it tonight, but he could.

Right now, Union Pacific, one of the country's biggest rail companies is embroiled in a battle with its own unions over Biden's vaccine mandate. But tonight, somehow he said, 'Oh, it's not really a problem'.

Now, we can't afford to have any more of our transportation infrastructure grind to a halt. So end these insane mandates now. Of course, Biden made clear at CNN town hall tonight that not going to happen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Should police officers, emergency responders be mandated to get vaccines? And if not, should they be stay at home, or let go?

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Yes, and yes. The mandates are working.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

INGRAHAM: Yes, and yes. And if you were hoping that Biden would outline plans to alleviate that supply crunch, or maybe just try to taper off inflation, not happening.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BIDEN: All the elements of these two bills have profound impact on economic growth, reduce not increase inflation, don't add a penny to the debt, as well as grow the economy. My proposals would actually reduce inflation.

COOPER: You think you'll have a deal by the time you get on Air Force One in eight days?

BIDEN: It's like my asking you, 'Are you sure, your next show is going to be a success?'

COOPER: Bottom line. Do you think you will get a deal?

BIDEN: I do think I'll get a deal.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

INGRAHAM: And Tinkerbell is going to just sprinkle pixie dust on Kyrsten Sinema, and she's just going to agree to everything they want. Now, if he continues this routine and rams this multi-trillion dollar agenda through, inflation is going to get worse. A lot worse. Everyone knows this. Which will only trigger Ingraham's second law of consequences. The more miserable a political party makes Americans, the more likely they're going to get thrown out of power.

Joining me now is former White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, author of the upcoming book, ""The Chief's Chief"". And also with me, Indiana Congressman, Jim banks; and Stephen Miller, former Trump Senior Advisor, founder of America First Legal.

Mark, tonight's town hall with Joe Biden. He had a big day for President Biden. This was really one of his busy days. He had a event at Martin Luther King Memorial earlier in the day, and then he did this 90-minute CNN town hall. What was your immediate takeaway?

MARK MEADOWS, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Listen, it was the most difficult hour and a half of TV that I've watched ever. I mean, listen to it. President Trump came out with a new social media company yesterday announced that on Fox. Listen, CNN had a new announcement tonight. Joe Biden has a new social network. It's called ramble.com. I mean, it was it was just pathetic.

And what do we have, we had Anderson Cooper not acting as a reporter or a moderator, he was the lifeguard throwing a life ring each and every time that Joe Biden started to ramble off. I mean, it was pathetic. And it just - we didn't learn much. But what we did learn is, it's to lower our expectation and hope for the best in six months from now.

INGRAHAM: Now, I mean, Stephen, he said a lot of things. He said, 'Well, people are worried that they're not going to be able to buy Christmas presents'. Like, Yes. They are worried about that. Now, what are you going to do about that? But he gave a really rambling and incoherent answer on gas prices. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BIDEN: Gas prices relate to a foreign policy initiative that is about something that goes beyond the cost of gas. And that's because of the supply being withheld by OPEC. And so there's a lot of negotiation that is - there's a lot of Middle Eastern folks want to talk to me.

You'll start to see gas prices come down as we get by in going into the winter - I mean, excuse me, into next year in 2022.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

INGRAHAM: Stephen, I don't even under - I honestly don't even know, what was that?

STEPHEN MILLER, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISER: If you had - well, let's - I mean, if you had a relative at the Christmas table that was that incoherent, you would - out of compassion, you would try to get them help, you would try to find a professional. I mean, this is - these are really concerning signs of cognitive decline.

And what's especially concerning is that Joe Biden's plan of talking to ""Middle Eastern men"", which I'm not sure what that means, has nothing to do with why energy prices are spiraling out of control, or just that he cancelled the pipelines, he cancelled the new oil and gas leases, he cancelled President Trump's energy independence policy, that brought gas prices to historic lows. He stopped the drilling, he stopped the fracking, and now energy is more expensive and harder to get than it's ever been before. It's not complicated. But I truly don't believe this man has a clue what is going on.

INGRAHAM: Oh, that was one of many instances tonight that I was actually worried about him personally.

Now, Congressman, to this point, though, I have to play this very important analysis from an esteemed CNN panel right after the town hall wrap. This was their take.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PAUL BEGALA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: This is not a presidency in crisis. This is right wing myth. That, ""Oh, he's just kind of out of it. And he's not really running things"". That shattered tonight. This is a guy truly in command of the presidency.

CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: He seemed to have unusually good command of the data. He was spitting a lot of facts.

DANA BUSH, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: He has been very engaged.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

INGRAHAM: OK. Does this look like he's in control? Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BIDEN: Percent of all products coming into the United States of America on the West Coast go through Los Angeles, and - and - oh, what am I doing here?

COOPER: Is it Long Beach or--

BIDEN: Long Beach. Thank you.

I said, you got to be open 24/7. No port there was open five days a week, 40 hours a week. 24/7.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

INGRAHAM: Congressman, he has no idea what's going on. I mean - I mean, Long Beach is kind of a hard thing to remember, I guess though.

REP. JIM BANKS (R-IN): And the left wing media is never going to hold him accountable for his lack of ability, for all of the mistakes that he's made over the last several months that have sent America down the spiral that we've seen. You've seen the left wing media come out this week, Laura, and say, that America should lower its expectations with Joe Biden in the White House.

And you see on CNN tonight, they're covering up for him. They're not going to hold him accountable for the inflation crisis, the border crisis, the debacle in Afghanistan, the supply chain crisis. All of these crises are a direct result of the Biden administration's policies. They're going to cover up for him every step of the way. They're never going to hold him accountable for it. And CNN proved that tonight.

INGRAHAM: Mark, Biden was asked about the border. Here's the exchange.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

COOPER: Do you have plans to visit the southern border?

BIDEN: I've been there before, and I haven't had a whole hell of a lot of time to get down. I've been spending time going around looking at the $900 billion worth of damage done by hurricanes and floods and weather, and traveling around the world.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

INGRAHAM: Mark, he's the president of the United States. He's the president of the United States. He can't go to the border because he is too busy with the hurricanes.

MEADOWS: Yes. So in 10 months he blames the hurricanes for him not going to the southern border. He blames OPEC for gas prices being too high when it was, as Stephen pointed out, he is canceling the Keystone pipeline and then giving a pass to Russia on the very same thing.

You know, when he started making those excuses, we found one other thing that all the forest fires, 50 percent of them happened because of power transmission towers falling over. I mean, it was just - as I started taking notes, I mean, I just - I felt sorry for him. But more importantly, I felt sorry for America. If this is the best we've got, we're in a deep problem. And you've been covering this from the very beginning.

Inflation will continue to erode away at the hardworking American taxpayer dollars. And his answer to it was to try to spend more money in government instead of actually getting the economy going. I had a low expectation for him going into this town hall and he exceeded my low expectation on the negative terms.

INGRAHAM: When he said he was too busy to go to the border, I think, how many weekends has he been in Delaware? I mean, riding the bike or whatever he is on.

MEADOWS: They don't have good ice cream on the southern border.

INGRAHAM: Oh, apparently not. Del Rio--

MILLER: No, Mark. It would melt. They couldn't enjoy it, going to be too hot down there.

INGRAHAM: Now, Stephen, I want to get to another issue involving the border, because this has been your focus for so many years, and obviously mine as well and commentary. So, Biden was asked about the policy toward unaccompanied minors at the border. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BIDEN: We're not sending back children. You'll notice, you're not seeing a lot of pictures of kids lying on top of one another with - with - with black - with you know, that looks like tarps on top of them.

What we're doing is bringing a lot of folks who are coming in and they're doing ankle bracelets instead of people being sent back, depending on whether or not their claim appears to be legitimate.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

INGRAHAM: And CNN's commentator said, this is a man in control. He could not remember the word, blanket. The aluminum blanket.

MILLER: Yes.

INGRAHAM: He struggled to remember the word blanket, people. That's an issue. Sorry.

MILLER: If you watch that - that - and we'll use the word again that Mark gave us, if you watch that ramble for two minutes, you should be frightened. You should be terrified. He has no clue, no idea, what his radical Marxist deputies are doing on immigration, real quick, unaccompanied minors.

His administration exempted them, categorically and illegally, from Title 42. That's why you've had 125,000 unaccompanied minors arrive, at least, minimum, under the Biden administration blowing every other year in American history out of the water and it's not even close. And they're being resettled in U.S. communities at taxpayer expense, burdening schools, burdening hospitals, and reconstituting and replenishing MS-13. It is a catastrophe. This man doesn't even know what's happening, because he is in decline. And like Mark said, I feel sorry for America.

INGRAHAM: Now, Mark, he was asked about Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema at one point. I don't know if he didn't remember her name - I - well, we'll watch. Well, we're going to get to that filibuster in a moment. But - the - I'm going to get to Sinema right now.

So he's asked about Sinema, he - he didn't remember her name, and then it was clear that he's trying to almost do a little negotiating on television during this town hall debate, about what was going on on Capitol Hill with this tax fight. How do you see that playing out? Because he really didn't want to get into it much, except say, it looks like they may not be able to raise a certain point of taxes in their final bill.

MEADOWS: Yes. So he went back and forth, talking about how smart senator Sinema was, but - or is. And quite frankly, that she is not in favor of increasing taxes, but she's in favor of the green component of his bill. And you got Joe Manchin, who's not in favor of the green component, but may be in favor of raising taxes.

And when you start putting the two together, he's not going to get a deal in eight days. And we had Anderson Cooper asking that, and - and he equivocated on the answer. But let me just tell you, this is all about his inability to actually find common ground. And Democrats are afraid. Democrats are afraid if they jump on the boat with him, that is a sinking ship. And you know what, they have every reason to be afraid, because it is a sinking ship. Inflation going crazy. We've got to make sure that we push back. \

INGRAHAM: All right. Congressman, President Biden also decided to take aim at the filibuster. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

COOPER: When it comes to voting rights - just so I'm clear, though - you would entertain the notion of doing away with the filibuster on that one issue? Is that correct?

BIDEN: And maybe more.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

INGRAHAM: And maybe more? Congressman, I thought he was going to get us back to restoring the normal course of business in Washington, the norms, right. Dignity, unity, all those things.

BANKS: Yes. Anything but - remember, that the first priority of Democrats in both the House and the Senate is to pass a bill to change election laws, to nationalize elections, to move all states to force, all states to go toward all mail-in ballots, to give Democrats an advantage over Republicans on Election Day.

That's their top priority. They made that very clear. They are transparent about that for years that that's the top priority, to change - to nationalize elections to give Democrats favor over Republicans on Election Day. And the way to do that is to end the filibuster.

So Joe Biden is being very transparent in a rare moment tonight on CNN. You heard it straight from the horse's mouth that this is where they're heading. We have to block them, because, Laura, it's clear. This is - this is the - this is their last hurrah. This is what they're going to try to do, to maintain power to give themselves permanent power to advance their radical socialist agenda. We can't let him do it.

INGRAHAM: Yes. It's getting so bad for the Democrats that even that gubernatorial race in New Jersey, it's down to six points. And we got--

BANKS: Exactly.

INGRAHAM: We got the leanings - the leanings are leaning toward the Republican candidate. So fascinating. Gentlemen, great to see you all tonight.

And Joe Biden use an event at the Martin Luther King Memorial today to obsess over white nationalism. Dinesh D'Souza reacts. Plus, Attorney General Merrick Garland was in the hot seat today, and Congressman Greg Steube caught him in some rank hypocrisy. He's here, next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

INGRAHAM: Attorney General Merrick Garland faced questions from House lawmakers for the first time in months today. And it wasn't pretty. Especially revealing was the hypocrisy exposed during this line of questioning from my next guest, Congressman Greg Steube.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. GREG STEUBE (R-FL): Most of us are lawyers here. So we use evidence in court. So we got two pictures here. One picture is from January 6 of individuals forcing themselves into the Capitol. This other picture is extremists forcing themselves into the Interior Department. Would you call both of these acts, domestic terrorism?

MERRICK GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL: Look, I'm not going to comment about particular matters. This is a matter that--

STEUBE: I'm not asking you to comment on a particular - I'm asking you to comment on these two photos.

GARLAND: One I know the facts of, the other I don't know the facts of.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

INGRAHAM: Florida congressman Greg Steube joins me now. Congressman, what did you think about the attorney general's answer there?

REP. GREG STEUBE (R-FL): Well, do we really think that he doesn't know the facts of an intrusion that happened into a government building blocks away from where his office actually sits?

What was the most amazing thing is, when I asked him about the incident, he said he wasn't aware of the incident at all, which is either an outright complete lie, or his deputies are refusing to even tell him of things that are happening when it's extremists, leftists, and progressive and socialist extremists. On the other side of the spectrum, when all they want to do is target conservatives in our country today.

INGRAHAM: Yes. So that was at the Interior Department. And it got almost no coverage, congressman.

STEUBE: Of course, not.

INGRAHAM: When I saw it on it --I saw it online in a few places, and I think Fox might have done something about it. But very, very little in the way of courage, but they were trying to get through that front door. I mean, they said so.

STEUBE: When they got in the front door, 55 people were actually arrested. There were officers and Police officers and security officers who were so injured, they had to go to the hospital. So you hear nothing about it. And as you could see from the pictures that I showed the AG, they look very similar to forcing their way into the Capitol, and forcing their way into the Department of Interior, both federal buildings under the same set of laws.

But the department is refusing to categorize that as domestic terrorists, but they have no problem categorizing what happened on January 6, as domestic terrorism. And the hypocrisy knows no bounds when it comes to the politicization that we have seen in the Department of Justice with the Biden administration.

INGRAHAM: Well, Joe Biden tonight on CNN, congressman, said that he was committed to ensuring that the Justice Department return to being an unbiased arbiter of law enforcement. So he insisted that things were copasetic over there.

STEUBE: Well, of course. And so AG Bartlett - AG Garland said the same thing today. It's just - they say what they want people to hear, but their actions are completely opposite of that. And the American people are smarter than that. The American people are smart enough to see that they're acting one way to one class of people with a certain ideology, and another way to another class of people with a different ideology.

And I wish I had more than five minutes, because I would have pressed him on the riots that we saw over these big cities over this past summer, that what happened to these people? Are they in solitary confinement? Are they being raided by the FBI SWAT teams and taken in, like the people in January 6?

We have a completely politicized Department of Justice. It has one set of rules and laws for one set of ideology in our country, and a completely different set of laws and rules for the people that support--

INGRAHAM: I want to get to another line of questioning from today. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you tell us without talking about particular incidents, or particular videos, how many agents or assets of the federal government were present on January 6? Whether they agitated to go into the Capitol, and if any of them did?

GARLAND: So, I'm not going to violate this norm of the rule of law. I'm not going to comment on an investigation that's ongoing.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

INGRAHAM: Congressman, why does that impact an investigation giving us an answer as to whether there were government officials in that crowd on January 6, either among the crowd, surveilling the crowd? How is that going to change the investigation? I'm not - I don't follow.

STEUBE: It doesn't impact the investigation at all. He refused to answer that question from multiple different members that had asked him that question. And there's been reports that there was undercover FBI agents, or FBI agents were inciting some of the violence, or FBI agents were pushing in through the door to encourage people and encourage what we saw happen on January 6. And they're outright refusing to answer our questions.

And they'll complete all these investigations. And he will still hide behind the fact that, well, we can't disclose that information. The Department of Justice doesn't have to disclose the results of an investigation. They will never tell the American people the truth. So we're relying upon some whistleblower to come forward and say, yes, this is what was going on January 6.

INGRAHAM: Congressman, fascinating today. Thank you.

And President Biden today commemorated the legacy of MLK by expanding the pool of Americans his administration considers to be domestic terrorists. Well - to well, beyond just parents.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BIDEN: I've said it before. And all my colleagues here know it. According to United States Intelligence community, domestic terrorism from white supremacists is the most lethal terrorist threat in the homeland. So that and our administration is carrying out the first ever comprehensive effort to tackle the threat.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

INGRAHAM: Joining me now is Dinesh D'Souza, conservative commentator and filmmaker. Dinesh, what do you think of Biden, focusing again as he did during the campaign on white supremacy as the biggest threat facing America today?

DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE AUTHOR & FILMMAKER: Well, I think that we've seen an escalating mode of argument. They started out by trying to say, Trump was a white supremacist. Then they tried to say, January 6 was motivated by white supremacy.

Now, they're saying that parents, who mobilize at school board meetings to oppose critical race theory and a whole bunch of other issues, they're a white supremacists, and they're domestic terrorists. So what you see here is - it's almost as if the national security state driven by the intelligence agencies is turning its sights away from Islamic terrorism, threats on the international scene, advances by China and technology and so on. And now turning its sights inward, in which domestic political opponents, dissenters, parents, dads and moms, who are trying to defend ultimately their children's welfare, they are being demonized as domestic terrorists. It's pathetic.

LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Merrick Garland today denied that. He said we don't consider concerned parents who are angry at school board meetings to be domestic terrorists. So I think they know this is hurting them, but nevertheless, Biden dipped in and out of the white supremacist rhetoric and kept beating that drum today.

He also decided to use this event today to go back to the well of questioning the integrity of our elections.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This struggle is no longer just about who gets to vote, or making it easier for eligible people to vote. It's about who gets to count the votes, whether they should count at all. Jim Crow in the 21st century is now a sinister combination of voter suppression and election subversion.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

INGRAHAM: Dinesh, what is he talking about here? I thought we weren't supposed to cast out our elections.

D'SOUZA: I think we're listening to the kind of talk that you might expect in a madhouse or maybe a faculty lounge. This makes absolutely no sense. Counting the votes, is there any attempt to stop people from counting a vote? No. What you really have is, remember, we have a country flooded by illegals. We know from the Maricopa audit that whatever the result, there were all kinds of processes that were violated. So the fact that states are taking steps to tighten up their procedures, make sure that only eligible people vote, this is now being described as Jim Crow.

Imagine people who really suffered under Jim Crow. They couldn't sit in a compartment or sit in the bus. They had to drink out of a separate water fountain. They couldn't go to the same school. These are people now looking and they're being told by their president that an I.D. voter requirement, for example, is the Jim Crow of the 21st century. It is a real insult to people who lived under Jim Crow.

INGRAHAM: Dinesh, thank you. Good to see you tonight.

And tell me if you've heard this one before. Anthony Fauci and Francis Collins lied about their efforts to fund gain-of-function research at that Wuhan lab. James Comer, the congressman who forced the NIH to fess up is here. He has breaking news in moments.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. JOHN KENNEDY, (R-LA): You gave them money and you said don't do gain- of-function research.

DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF MEDICAL ADVISER: Correct.

KENNEDY: And they said, we won't.

FAUCI: Correct.

SEN. RAND PAUL, (R-KY): Dr. Fauci, do you still support funding of the -- NIH funding of the lab in Wuhan?

FAUCI: Senator Paul, with all due respect, you are entirely and completely incorrect, that the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

INGRAHAM: Well, now we know that was likely alive. For more on the breaking developments, we go to Matt Finn in our West Coast Newsroom. Matt?

MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Laura, the National Institutes of Health now admits that U.S. tax dollars were used to fund a limited experiment at the Wuhan lab to test if spike proteins from bat coronaviruses in China were capable of binding to humans. In a letter to Representative James Comer, a director from the NIH states that lab mice that were infected with a modified bad virus became sicker than mice that were given an unmodified bad virus.

However the NIH claims that these particular bad viruses tested in the Wuhan lab could not have become the COVID virus. And the NIH director also claims that the NIH granted funds to a New York City based nonprofit EcoHealth which then sub-granted money to the Wuhan lab without being transparent about the testing taking place.

All this information comes as Dr. Fauci repeatedly denied that U.S. dollars were funding gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab. Senator Rand Paul led the charge on the idea that the coronavirus came from the Wuhan lab and has since tweeted ""I told you so doesn't even begin to cover it here."" Senator Paul had this to say tonight on FOX NEWS PRIMETIME.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. RAND PAUL, (R-KY): They still to this day are trying to get around the truth. They say, well, it was unexpected that it gained function. How do you know if it's unexpected or not? It's unknown. So when it gains function, that is something that actually is expected.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

FINN: Senator Paul questioned Dr. Fauci about U.S. dollars paying for the gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab in May, and then again in July.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. RAND PAUL, (R-KY): Dr. Fauci, knowing that it is a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th where you claimed that the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan?

DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF MEDICAL ADVISER: I have never lied before the Congress, and I do not retract that statement.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

FINN: Top scientists, including Dr. Fauci and his boss, NIH Director Francis Collins, say they cannot rule out the theory that the pandemic was the result of a laboratory accident without more cooperation from the Chinese government. Laura?

INGRAHAM: Matt, thank you.

And joining me now is the congressman who forced the NIH to fess up, Ranking Member of the House Oversight Committee James Comer. Congressman, I'm not shocked because I knew this all along, because smart people knew what was going on in that Wuhan lab, but how is this not the biggest story, or one of the top three stories at least in America tonight?

REP. JIM COMER, (R-KY) HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE RANKING MEMBER: It should be. This proves all along that this virus was started in the Wuhan lab. And this proves all along that American tax dollars were used to fund gain-of- function research in the Wuhan lab. The national -- the NIH knew this all along. Dr. Fauci misled the committee at best, and lied to the committee at worst, by saying that tax dollars were never used for gain-of-function knowledge or gain-of-function research.

And what they're trying to do now, Laura, is they're trying to change the definition of gain-of-function research. But in layman's term, they were taking this virus, and they were making it worse. They were genetically modifying it. They were genetically altering it. They were taking a deadly virus and making it worse. And that violates the terms of the tax dollars for the grant that EcoHealth Alliance got.

So this is bad. This is more wrongdoing from the Biden administration, and we're going to keep on on this. It is very disappointing that the intelligence committee spent 90 days looking into the origination of COVID- 19, and they said, oh, we can't find anything.

INGRAHAM: What are we getting for our intel dollars except American citizens being targeted themselves? We have to start asking this question.

COMER: We do, and we continue to ask the question. Jim Jordan has been the champion on questioning the intelligence community about the effectiveness and efficiency.

INGRAHAM: Hypersonic missile, Congressman, now this?

COMER: Yes, absolutely.

INGRAHAM: Come on, billions of dollars down a rathole, and then the American people are the ones being surveilled.

COMER: Exactly.

INGRAHAM: The whole thing -- but the media did have a role, Congressman, in propping up Fauci's big lie. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN ANCHOR: Nothing brings out Senator Paul's propensity to act like an ass like a congressional appearance by Fauci.

JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: Trump allies in Congress and governors' offices and the media trying to make Fauci a COVID bogeyman.

DON LEMON, CNN HOST, ""DON LEMON TONIGHT"": There's nothing to prove there, and he keeps embarrassing himself. Rand Paul, stop it. You look like an idiot.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

INGRAHAM: Congressman, they are collaborators.

COMER: They have, and I don't think that is any surprise to any good FOX beer. But here's the bottom line -- they knew all along that tax dollars were going into this lab. We wasted months and months and months of investigations to try to prove what they knew all along, that tax dollars were going to this lab, and they were doing risky experimental research that they shouldn't have been doing. And then to say, well, we don't know where this COVID-19 originated from is ridiculous. It's embarrassing. The Chinese are laughing at us right now. And we have got to hold this administration accountable, and I think you are going to see, Laura, more whistleblowers come forward --

INGRAHAM: We should hope so.

COMER: -- people in the health community now that know what was going on in that lab. They knew all along what is going on in the lab.

INGRAHAM: All right, Congressman, we've got to roll. But thank you for doing what you did to shed light on this. We really appreciate it.

And three weeks ago we told you the arrest of Pastor Artur Pawlowski for bucking Canada's insane COVID edicts. He just got his sentence. You will not believe the story out of Canada tonight.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

PASTOR ARTUR PAWLOWSKI, ORDERED TO PARROT STATE ""EXPERTS"": I was handcuffed like a common criminal, like a terrorist, like Al Qaeda's most wanted, taken to police, thrown into solitary confinement like a criminal. I was not allowed to see my wife, not allowed to hug my children. They wanted to break me. They want to show the whole world, you see what we do to those that dare to speak against our tyranny. If you would follow the footsteps of Pastor Artur Pawlowski, you're next.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

INGRAHAM: And now less than three weeks since that appearance on THE ANGLE, Pastor Artur Pawlowski has been sanctioned by a Canadian court. His sentence includes a $23,000 fine, 18 months probation, 120 hours of community service. But by the way, that is not all. The court also compelled the pastor to parrot the expert talking points on masks, vaccines, and social distancing, even in his sermons.

Pastor Pawlowski joins me now. Pastor, the court is telling you now what you can say about COVID? And this is actually legal up north. OK, good.

PASTOR ARTUR PAWLOWSKI, ORDERED TO PARROT STATE ""EXPERTS"": I'm telling you, unbelievable. Crazy stuff, compelled speech like in China and North Korea. It feels like I am back at home 40 years ago growing up, as you remember, behind the Iron Curtain under the boots of the Soviets. They always had those show trials, as they called it, for the people to enjoy and bring more fear and tyranny into their hearts, exactly what is happening right now.

INGRAHAM: Now, apparently any time now, according to this court order, any time you publicly contradict the health officials, they order you to repeat the following, I'm reading just part of it, ""I'm obliged to inform you that the majority of medical experts favor social distancing, mask wearing, and avoiding large crowds. Most medical experts also support participation in vaccine programs. Vaccinations have been shown statistically to save lives and reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms.""

A lot of people believe that. I think obviously vulnerable people especially get some relief, no doubt, from severity of COVID and even death. But this does seem almost like a hostage tape situation. You're forced to say these words kind of like under a Maoist regime China. How is this a free country?

PAWLOWSKI: That's exactly what was happening when Mao Zedong took over China. He forced the citizens to repeat the mantra, or the prayer, if you will, to the government. When I was growing up, we were reciting those prayers as well, citing that Stalin was our grandfather, that he was the savior of Europe, et cetera. The same tactics are being done right now. You see they are so terrified of the truth, they are so terrified of a man that is speaking the truth that they are forcing me to lie to the public, which of course, I cannot do. I cannot go against my own conscience, against the freedom of religion, freedom of everything. In a free and democratic society, I just can't imagine. I'm speechless. I don't know what is going on with the Canadian government, but this judge is not a judge, he never was a judge. He is a political activist working for China-da right now.

INGRAHAM: What do you mean working for China? Explain that.

PAWLOWSKI: Working for China-da. I don't call Canada anymore ""Canada."" It's China-da, which is a mix of communism and fascism, I guess, today. Those orders, those mandates, those restrictions, it looks like the government wants to hire me to be a CNN reporter, and just every time I open my mouth, I have to live.

INGRAHAM: And now your prime minister, of course, is prioritizing the vaccine mandates. Pfizer just pushed tonight, this week, last night, the five through 11 vaccinations, asking the Canadian government to approve vaccinations for younger children. Then a poll comes out magically the same night saying, well, half of Canadians plan to get five to 11-year-olds vaccinated. It all seems almost coordinated, Pastor.

PAWLOWSKI: And that is exactly what it is. The whole thing is a sham. It's a lie. And I would never comply with an order like this. Actually, the minute he pronounced there was a large crowd gathered outside of the court chanting ""Free Pastor Artur Pawlowski."" I grabbed the mic and I said to the judge and to the hold world, I shall not comply. I refuse to comply. This is still Canada. I'm not living in China and I'm not living in North Korea. I will not, I refused to bow before the tyrannical orders like that.

Another thing is he was so terrified, the government is so terrified of me traveling, I spent four months in the United States, he is banning me to leave my province. I have become a political prisoner in my own province of Alberta.

INGRAHAM: What? Oh, no.

PAWLOWSKI: I cannot leave my province for 18 months right now.

INGRAHAM: You are obviously a danger to society, Pastor. You look so dangerous to me, just sharing an opinion. Pastor, we are going to be following this case as it develops. It seems like this is going to go on. Thank you for standing strong, and good luck to you, sir.

PAWLOWSKI: Thank you so much.

INGRAHAM: Will someone give Joe Biden a lozenge? Our last highlight from Biden is tonight's Last Bite.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

INGRAHAM: Joe Biden give a really full-throated response tonight.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Community colleges are dealing with apprenticeships, teaching a skill. So I think we can get all of that done.

(APPLAUSE)

Stop my administration.

So that's what the agenda is.

What we do to highways and all that kind of thing, hard data.

And I went before the joint session of Congress.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

INGRAHAM: Would someone just hand him a lozenge next time? I mean, the poor man.

That's it for us tonight. It's happened to me too. Thank you were watching. Remember, it's America now and forever. Freedom Matters, all the proceeds go to charity. Go to LauraIngraham.com, great gear, including the new favorite, yes, Freedom Matters.

2021-10-22,Hannity,Fox News,Sean Hannity,"ANNOUNCER: Americans Held Hostage, Abandoned Behind Enemy Lines, Day 69.

SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Welcome to HANNITY this busy news Friday night.

Sixty-nine days, Americans held behind enemy lines, thousands of green cardholders, SIV applicants, their families -- we have no idea the exact number -- all suffering in silence under Taliban rule. I know the rest of the media and Joe Biden have, quote, turned the page. We won't do that. Many are already dead.

But during last night's town hall, on fake news, CNN Joe Biden didn't make a single mention of Afghanistan or the men or the women and children and Americans and green cardholders and allies he abandoned after 13 days prior saying he wouldn't do it. Not a mention, not a question, not a word nothing -- wow.

Now, it's possible Joe doesn't even fully remember what happened in Afghanistan that's way back in august and for him, that's -- you know, 400 lifetimes ago. It was a whole three months ago and let's face it, Joe Biden's not particularly doing well and that was on display last night that he is everything we've been telling you -- a cognitive mess. Every day, it seems to get worse and worse. It's scary. It's not funny anymore.

Predictably last night -- well, the town hall became a train wreck. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Fifty-five corporations for example in the United States of America making over $40 billion don't pay a cent, not a single little red cent.

You know if you're in real estate, major real estate, ask them, they know they should be paying a little more than 21 percent. We can pay for this whole thing, I haven't written in a card here, but I won't bore you with the detail.

ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: The question was on the on community colleges, which was a big campaign promise that you made. You talked about that on the campaign trail.

BIDEN: Yeah, and I'm going to get it done. And if I don't, I'll be sleeping alone for a long time.

I'm going off to COP-26 in Scotland and -- and I don't know, I guess it's two weeks or a week, I'm losing track of time of all.

Forty percent of products coming into the United States of America and the West Coast go through Los Angeles and -- what am I doing here?

COOPER: Is it Long Beach?

BIDEN: Long Beach, thank you.

So what I have said, you're shaking your head no, but let me tell you something, Jack, it's the truth.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: Well, what am I doing here, Long Beach? Yeah, yeah, yeah, thanks for the save, Long Beach.

At one point, Biden seemingly forgot about his own hands and just stood there like this for an extended period of time. Does anybody know what he was doing like that? What was that all about?

And, of course, throughout the night, Biden offered zero solutions for all of the crisis that he himself had caused. I have solutions, bring back the Trump policies on the border, on energy, on Afghanistan, peace through strength, on the economy, lower regulation, lower taxes. That all work, you know?

But according to Joe, spiking gas prices -- they're not going to be getting better anytime soon and he blamed OPEC. It's not OPEC's fault, it's your fault, Joe. Why don't you call Texas? Why don't you call Oklahoma, North Dakota, Alaska? Why don't you hire back the Keystone XL pipeline workers you fired and maybe take back that waiver you gave your friend Vladimir, who pays you -- whose country pays your son millions with no experience? You know, saying there's nothing I can do about high gas prices. Wow, that -- that's so reassuring.

Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

COOPER: What about gas prices because something is interesting --

BIDEN: Gas prices relate to a foreign policy initiative that is about something goes beyond the cost of gas, and that's because of the supply being withheld by OPEC and so there's a lot of negotiation that is -- there's a lot of Middle Eastern folks want to talk to me. I'm not sure I'm going to talk to them.

COOPER: Do you have a timeline for gas prices when you think they may start coming down?

BIDEN: My guess is you'll start to see gas prices come down as we get by and going into the winter -- I mean, excuse me, and the next year in 2022. I don't see anything that's going to happen in the meantime it's going to significantly reduce gas prices.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: The supply is not withheld by OPEC. You Joe Biden you artificially reduced the supply of energy in the world because you are married to the Biden-Bernie New Green Deal Socialist Green New Deal manifesto.

Joe Biden, you killed the Keystone XL pipeline. You're making the hostile actor Putin rich again. You're the one that banned oil and gas exploration on all federal lands.

You artificially reduced America's and the world's oil and gas supply. And now, the United States once again -- now, you're begging OPEC, countries that hate us, for the lifeblood of our economy. And we're paying a buck more a gallon and paying more for every single thing we buy, and paying more to heat and cool our homes.

Under Donald Trump, we were the world's number one producer of oil and gas for the first time in 75 years, guess what, we were energy independent.

Donald Trump, at the end of his presidency, wasn't importing one single barrel from Saudi Arabia. Now anymore instead of begging Texas, why don't we make them? I'd rather ask -- you can ask Texas, you don't even have to beg. Oklahoma, Alaska, North Dakota, they'll help you.

Biden, you're blaming OPEC. That is a cop-out and frankly it's an all-out lie like most everything else that comes out of your mouth.

And according to the former CEO of McDonald's, Biden's oil and gas policies are the cause core of inflation in the country and the current supply chain fiasco. The labor shortage also is playing a huge role, but Joe Biden, he is now vowing to make that shortage even far worse.

If he does what we're about to play and it happens with nurses and teachers and first responders and our military -- you think the economy is bad now, it will go down precipitously right into the sewer. Listen to Joe.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

COOPER: Should police officers, emergency responders be mandated to get vaccines? And if not, should they be stay at home or let go?

BIDEN: Yes and yes..

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: Oh, fire them. Okay, at this point, I'll take ""let's go, Brandon"". I'll take Brandon in the NASCAR driver over Biden.

Biden went on to mock Americans obsession with freedom? Wow.

Now, is he going to do -- you're going to do that, Joe? Is that going to do it, just spit in the faces of millions of Americans? They're not going to listen to you, Joe. They're not going to listen to flip-flop Fauci. They're not going to listen to the ever-changing you know rules of the CDC or the NIH. You caused this vaccine hesitancy, all of you.

And by the way, because of that and because of the mixed messaging and because of the shifting and changing standards, they've made up their own mind. Now, you can try to convince them, but you've been trying, and it's not working. And you -- now, you're going to fire them.

I thought you said you'd never implement a mandate, Joe. Fauci said it. Pelosi said it. Psaki said it. You all said it wouldn't happen.

Now, Americans are being mandated. What happened to the choice of at least getting tested? Do you still offer them that option, or are you going to take away their pay, their benefits, their pensions?

Now, of course, the debate frankly in my mind is over. It's not -- no longer in this country about vax or not vax, because millions of Americans, they have made up their mind and they don't agree with Joe Biden for whatever reason. We've had that debate.

That's their choice. We live in a free society, and their decision. Now, there's got to be a way to thread the needle because if you have all these people willing to sacrifice their jobs, their pay, their benefits, their pensions, their careers, their salaries over mandates they must believe pretty strongly in their position.

Now, make no mistake, thousands of cops, firefighters, nurses, first responders, soldiers walking off the job? If that happens, this country will not be more safe and secure and it'll have a devastating impact on our economy.

Joe Biden and his radical advisors do not care about safety and security. They only care about politics. Just look at the border. In order to appease the radical left, Joe Biden not only is not enforcing the laws of the land, Donald Trump's plans work, and he can implement them once again, and they'll work once again.

Instead, he's decided to go out on his own and Joe Biden -- now, where are we? We're now at a record high, 40-year record high of illegal immigrants coming into the country, ironically the same time Biden started construction of a giant wall around his beach house. By the way, it's going to cost you almost 500 grand.

Now, the southeastern border is a disaster. Apprehensions are at an all- time high. We're on track for nearly 2-million-plus illegal immigrants this year. And by the way, that's where percent of heroin crosses into this country through our southern border. Fentanyl is killing hundreds of Americans a week. That's crossing across the southern border.

Joe, he's just too busy to visit, so he lies about visiting and says the drive-through is a visit. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

COOPER: Do you have plans to visit the southern border?

BIDEN: I've been there before and I haven't -- I mean, I know it well, I guess I should go down but the -- but the whole point of it is I haven't had a whole hell of a lot of time to get down. I've been spending time going around looking at the $900 billion dollars worth of damage done by hurricanes and floods and weather and traveling around the world.

But I plan on -- now, my wife Jill has been down. She's been on both sides of the river. She's seen the circumstances there. She's looked into those places.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: This guy is a cognitive mess. He's your president.

Wow, I sent my wife down to look at it and he never went there? Not too busy to spend nearly every weekend in Delaware, at your beach house, right, Joey?

And don't worry, your border czar, Kamala Harris, oh yeah, she swung by El Paso once on her way to California, while she was spewing carbon emissions left and right. And, of course, she has no plans to go back.

And by the way, we -- you know, we've been looking at this for months. We can't find any record of Joe Biden ever, one time, visiting the border. Jen Psaki got into it again with our own Peter Doocy and Joe Biden was definitely not lying she says. Oh really? What he did, a drive-by? That counts as a visit to the border?

Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Why did President Biden say he has been to the border?

JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, Peter, as you may have seen, there's been a reporting that he did drive through the border when he was on the campaign trail in 2008.

DOOCY: Does that count as a visit? He said I've been there before. You're saying he drove by for a few minutes, does that count?

PSAKI: What do you -- what is the root cause? Where are people coming from who are coming to the border, Peter?

DOOCY: The president said --

PSAKI: I'm asking you -- I'm asking you a question because I think people should understand the context. Where do people -- where do people come --

(CROSSTALK)

DOOCY: I'm asking you --

PSAKI: Okay, I'll answer it for you -- people come from Central America and Mexico to go to the border. There is a focus right now on a photo-op. The president does not believe a photo-op is the same as solutions. That may be a difference he has with Republicans.

DOOCY: But that's not what he said here. He said, I guess I should go down. So, does he think that he needs a photo-up? Is that what he's saying?

PSAKI: He doesn't and that's a fundamental disagreement he has.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: All right. If the White House has any evidence that Biden actually stopped and visited the southern border, we'd love to see it. They're lying, and if Joe Biden had a solution to the southern border crisis, we'd like to hear about that.

Here's the thing they don't have, and that is a solution. I have one. Follow the Trump plan. They're not working on a solution. They don't care what happens at the border.

And tonight, they're focused on one thing above all else -- New Green Deal radical socialism packaged in this Build Back Better propaganda talking points and bumper stickers. This bill is a massive step of America, the greatest wealth creating system in the entire history of mankind, now becoming a socialist hell hole, you know, like the former Soviet Union, Venezuela, Cuba.

Okay, simply put -- it takes money from everybody that works and gives it to everyone else. That is confiscation of pretty much all of the economy, in the form of fairness and government entitlements. The bill raises taxes on everyone, especially those making under grand a year. Joe's lying on that too.

It will increase both the debt and deficit on a massive scale, even though they lie and say it won't cost a single penny. Inflation, which is already really bad, is going to get worse. The bill will replace reliable forms of energy, you know, like oil and gas and coal, with unreliable costly forms of energies, you know, oh, windmills and solar panels that are not proven reliable.

If, Joe Manchin, if you really care about the people of West Virginia and I believe you do, you will vote no on any form of this bill.

Here now with more from the White House, our own Peter Doocy.

You know, the idea that Jen Psaki wants to flip roles and she wants to be the questioner and get you to answer her questions, it's not a matter. You made a good point. Did he ever visit the border?

Now, Peter I've been down there on horseback. I've been down there on helicopters. I've been on all-terrain vehicles, and there's even film of me in tunnels out there when people are getting arrested in drug warehouses and me nearly falling off a horse. So, I've been down firsthand and seen the border times. He has to go down and see it. He never did, did he? She lied to you?

DOOCY: No, and what they are referring to, this new reporting that today, several weeks after I asked if he had ever been and they said they would check just mysteriously appeared in ""The Washington Post"" is of 2008 -- before the 2008 election. So it was still Obama and McCain at the tops of the ticket. Joe Biden went out to an event in Las Cruces, New Mexico but he landed in El Paso.

So what the White House is saying counts as a trip down to the border is the drive in a motorcade from El Paso's airport to a rally in Las Cruces. This -- and you've been in some of these motorcades, so have I, you're going very fast and the cars are moving around kind of side to side within the lanes and you can't roll down the window, you can't stop.

And so, it sounds like somebody -- yeah, and so what they are saying and the president went on last night in that clip he says, I know it well. Well, he knows it as well as somebody who was able to see some of that fence in El Paso, and that's it.

HANNITY: Your question had nothing to do with the photo-op. Your question was fundamental. Did Joe Biden lie to the American people when he said that he went down and he's -- and he visited the border? You didn't ask about a photo op, and you asked and you've asked this question before, Peter.

Now, if Donald Trump were president, everybody else in that room would follow up and say what do you mean you drove by it in a motorcade? That's not going to the border.

DOOCY: And, Sean, it goes to the point though, if that is going to count as a visit, then really why get out of the car for anything. And when he flies back and forth from -- directly from the South Lawn to Wilmington near his house there, and he can see Maryland out the window, does that count as a visit to Maryland? Because that's basically what they're saying his length of stay was at the border.

HANNITY: Well, if I guess if I'm flying in an airplane into Reagan airport and I see the White House and I see the Pentagon, I can say I've been there based on their definition.

All right. Peter Doocy, great job. You're killing it every day in there.

I don't think they like Peter as much as they pretend to.

Anyway, here with more, he's a columnist for ""The Hill"", FOX News contributor, I think he'd be a great media host on a media show here on FOX, Joe Concha. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is with us.

All right. This is your wheelhouse, Joe. I'll throw it up to you -- he lied. Yes, flat-out lied.

JOE CONCHA, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's the word here, right? And where to begin, by the way, with that town hall last night?

I mean, the president claiming that he's been to the border was bad enough, right? But now, you have this press secretary, as you just talked about with Peter Doocy, where she has gone full Baghdad Bb at this point, Sean. She somehow makes the argument that driving through El Paso 13years ago counts as going to the border? So if you're packing all this at home because Biden drove through El Paso 13 years ago -- remember, El Paso is a three-hour walk from the U.S. Mexico border.

Because he did that in 2008, that means he's been to the border. Meanwhile, the president says he's been too busy to visit the border, that's incredible because he has spent 70 days in Delaware since taking office and we're barely 10 months in.

Psaki then goes on to say, Biden does not need to visit and does not need a visit to the border to know what a mess was left by the last administration, unquote. This is enough to make someone's hair hurt, because the numbers are the numbers and to your point the press secretary is outright lying.

Now as for CNN, for that town hall last night, they finished dead last in a three-horse race. Ratings were horrific, just 1.2 million people tuned in. And those few who did tune in didn't hear one question from Anderson Cooper who was a former war correspondent in Afghanistan asking about that particular horrific situation. And Cooper, to your point also before, played wingman, more than moderator, and helping the president remember places like the port of Long Beach where there's a supply chain crisis.

So there's a reason, Sean, why Jen Psaki and this president, the handlers chose CNN because not reaching a big audience -- certainly that wasn't one of the reasons, that's for sure. And at this point, CNN losing 80 percent of its audience since the beginning of the year, this network may soon need to start addressing viewers by name.

HANNITY: They barely got a million viewers last night. Donald Trump calls this program on a telephone and we get four million viewers. He's on a phone. We're not even seeing him.

Let me go to Governor Huckabee. Governor Huckabee, he said a lot of other things last night. He supports firing -- firing first responders, police if they don't get the shot. He's not offering them the option of testing. He is open to eliminating the filibuster.

He also said, at one point, he can -- so confused, what am I doing here? And then Anderson Cooper had to bail him out, ,so he's a cognitive mess, admitting inflation is going to last for quite a while, blaming OPEC for gas prices when he artificially reduced the world supply, admitting has no near-term solution for reducing gas prices. And governor, this is a prescription for economic disaster.

MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first of all, it wasn't a town hall. Let's be real clear. This was a game show. It was called who wants to be president and Joe kind of thinks he might like to try the job sometime.

Anderson Cooper was his lifeline last night. But instead of a millionaire - - who wants to be a millionaire, this was who wants to be a trillionaire president giving away free stuff.

But I'm really disappointed in both you and Joe for criticizing him for not going to the border. He has been repeatedly to Taco Bell in Wilmington, Delaware, so he has already made a run for the border and you guys just are not appreciating just totally clued in he is on the border.

HANNITY: Listen, I plead guilty. I am a smelly Walmart shopper. I cling to God above, I believe in God, and I -- the Bible I take is the sacred word of God and I believe in my Second Amendment rights, that I cling to my religion. I'm guilty on all fronts and I like Taco Bell, yes, sir, you're right. But is that is --

(CROSSTALK)

HUCKABEE: Well, let me just mention this, Sean.

HANNITY: Yeah?

HUCKABEE: Let me just mention this, there were 12 questions asked and only two of them were asked by people who pretended to be Republican. And so, that gives you some idea of the fact that CNN thinks that a town hall is only a town hall if the town contains 90 percent Democrats to make it as easy as possible on poor Joe, and even then, he couldn't figure out where he was and where Long Beach was. It was a pretty bad night, the White House had to do a fact check on their own guy last night and start correcting everything he was saying, as it was coming out of his mouth.

HANNITY: You missed one other thing, he said he's been vice president for 36 years, did you know that, Joe Concha?

CONCHA: Wow, that's going to be a record, right?

(CROSSTALK)

CONCHA: By the way, yeah, Sean, when we're covering this administration and this president, don't judge them by their words, judge them by their actions, as it pertains to the supply chain crisis, because just the border and the president not visiting there, wait how long it'll take and we're talking months, maybe never, will Joe Biden, Kamala Harris or secretary -- Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg visit any of the ports in California or Georgia or New Jersey in terms of addressing that problem and talking to those people working there on the ground or trucking executives meeting them in person saying how do we solve this problem?

So, judge them by their actions and not their words because we have an absentee president, vice president and Pete Buttigieg as transportation secretary, after he ran South Bend, Indiana. Now, he has a job that has a $100 billion budget and 58,000 employees, and he has been out to lunch for two months on paternity leave.

HANNITY: And he's planning on running for president, according to a report out tonight.

All right, I'm going to make a run to the border right after this show, if that's that -- they're open.

Governor Huckabee, thank you. Thanks for the idea, brilliant.

Anyway, Joe Concha, Mike Huckabee.

Coming up, Joe Biden blatantly mocking -- you know, we've had the lectures, we've had the scolding, now, he's mocking Americans that have a different view on the vaccine. Leo 2.0 Terrell, former Senator Scott Brown will react.

And new questions tonight, Dr. Fauci lied to Congress, we now know for a fact the NIH money did go for gain of function and coronavirus research at the Wuhan virology lab. He lied to us, straight ahead.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(NEWSBREAK)

HANNITY: And tonight, we have even more disturbing moments from Biden's fake news CNN town hall from last night. He actually mocked, remember, he has scolded in the past. He's lectured in the past. He's demanded in the past. Now, he's mocking Americans that have a different point of view than him.

And for whatever reason, they made the choice not to get vaccinated, for reasons I guess some of them have underlying rare medical conditions. There are rare conditions. Some have natural immunity and they're following that science. You may not agree with them, but that's what they're doing.

They've decided to stand on their principles. That will be their choice. We live in a free society.

Here's how Joe Biden after he has lectured them and scolded them and yelled at them, here's what he's saying now. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BIDEN: The two things that concern me: one, are those who just try to make this a political issue, freedom. I have the freedom to kill you with my COVID. No, I mean, come on, freedom.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: Here now with reaction, FOX News contributor Leo 2.0 Terrell, former Republican congressman from the state of Massachusetts -- by the way, his wife is running from on a very winnable seat for a very winnable seat in New Hampshire. I might have to start asking her instead of you on the program, just saying, Scott.

Anyway, welcome back.

Let me just start -- let's just focus a little bit on what we just heard there. They said they would never do this. Just like they've been wrong all throughout, the pandemic that's point number one.

I have a hard time and I've been very clear, Senator, I believe in science, vaccination science, I'm begging people to take it seriously. I've seen the worst of it under -- you know, you have a unique medical history and condition, please talk to your doctors. If you get a breakthrough case or you didn't get vaccinated, call your doctor immediately ask them if it's right to get for you monoclonal antibodies. I've taken it seriously, I do now.

For whatever reason, I don't think these people's minds are going to be changed. I have a problem firing nurses and military and first responders that dove on COVID bombs every day to save our lives in the worst moments here.

There see -- there has to be a better way to thread that needle. Why not allow them to have a test every day or once a week or whatever?

SCOTT BROWN, FORMER SENATOR FOR MASSACHUSETTS: Well, because they don't want to. The federal government is obviously playing more and more of a role in our lives, interfering with our personal liberties and freedoms.

I live in the Live Free or Die state. We take these rights and freedoms very, very seriously, and with all due respect to the president, mocking people because in the name of freedom, yeah, we still are a free country. But you wouldn't know it.

And what they're doing as you referenced earlier, they are lying. They said you don't have to do it now. They're making everybody do it and they're making them choose between their jobs and their security, not only our national security but their own personal and family security, Sean. It's completely unacceptable.

It's really an extension of the defund the police -- dividing people, pushing people away. You see the amount of applause from all those people in there, applauding all those first-line responders and police officers who come and could put their life and limb at jeopardy, they're applauding them because they're going to be fired or stay home.

First time, Sean, I'm 62 years old, first time in my life I'm getting -- I'm getting a little bit scared and, you know, I'm not quite sure what to do.

HANNITY: You know, I'm telling everybody, Leo, to take it seriously. You've been on this program enough, you know what I'm saying. I've -- I have friends that died.

Now, I believe -- but on top -- but with that, I believe in freedom. I believe in medical privacy. I believe in doctor-patient confidentiality.

And, you know, I don't believe in one-size-fits-all medicine either and what I don't understand is there's got to be a way that people are feeling so strong, they're going to give up their pay, they're going to give up their benefits, they're going to give up their careers, their pensions, and nobody is willing to think out of the box and find a way to have a safe working environment.

We have packed football stadiums every Saturday and Sunday, Leo.

LEO TERRELL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Every week, we have packed football stadiums throughout the entire country, playoff baseball game.

But let me tell you right now, this is all about power and control. I find it insulting for Joe Biden who should be fired to insinuate that police officers and first responders want to kill their fellow police officers, responders, by not having -- by not taking the vaccine, that's insulting, it's stupid. It's outright stupid.

These individuals -- these first responders who gave their life up sacrificed 24/7, putting their own family in harm's way to protect us 24/7.

And Joe Biden cavalierly wants to say, oh, freedom to kill, are you serious? It's insulting. And his bottom line is, it's just a part of the Democratic playbook. They want power and control over every aspect of our lives.

There's no mandates in Florida. It's not required in Florida, but yet, Biden looks at this as a power grab, and the Democrats don't understand it, that freedom and liberty is something worth dying for and something worth fighting for.

HANNITY: Leo 2.0 Terrell, Scott Brown, thank you.

And coming up, a bombshell new report claiming that the NIH in fact did fund gain of function research at the virology lab in Wuhan. What does this mean for flip flop Fauci? Did he lie to Congress?

And later, Alec Baldwin accidentally shot and killed a cinematographer on the set of his new movie, injuring also the director. We'll tell you what happened, straight ahead.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HANNITY: And now, more big breaking news this Friday night surrounding Dr. doom and gloom, flip-flop Fauci because we have perhaps the most important piece of evidence yet supporting claims that Fauci did in fact lie to Congress when he told Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky multiple times that the NIH never funded gain a function research at the Wuhan lab. Because get this, in a new letter to Republican Congressman James Comer, an NIH official admitted the truth that was -- that an experiment was conducted at the Wuhan lab backed by U.S. funding, quote, to test if spike proteins from naturally occurring bat coronaviruses circulating in China were capable of binding to the human receptor in a mouse model. That would be by its very definition gain of function research.

Now, the NIH is trying to do damage control claiming that the Eco Health Alliance, which they gave the grant to and received your tax dollars, then subcontracted with the Wuhan lab, and wasn't being transparent about the research.

That prompted Senator Rand Paul to respond on Twitter saying, I told you so, doesn't even begin to cover it here.

So, Dr. Paul was right. Flip flop Fauci was wrong, and appears to have lied repeatedly including to Congress. You might remember this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): Dr. Fauci, knowing that it is a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th where you claimed that the NIH never funded gain of function research in Wuhan?

DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NIAID: Senator Paul, I have never lied --

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Microphone.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Your microphone.

FAUCI: Senator Paul, I have never lied before the Congress and I do not retract that statement.

PAUL: An animal virus and you increase this transmissibility to humans, you're saying that's not gain a function?

FAUCIJ: Yeah, that is correct. And, Senator Paul, you do not know what you are talking about quite frankly and I want to say that officially.

(END VIDEOI CLIP)

HANNITY: Okay, officially, I'm saying I don't believe Fauci.

Now, what's it going to take to have some real accountability for Fauci, who has flip-flopped on mask, on ventilators, projections, herd immunity, vaccine passports, holiday gatherings, on the virus origins, we'll never have a vaccine mandate and much more.

And worst of all, it looks like he lied potentially to Congress. That would be against the law.

Here now, former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, FOX News contributor Jason Chaffetz.

Reince, start with you. Okay, we've got the emails that we've gone over January 31st, the day of the Trump travel ban, 10 days after the first case of corona in the U.S., Fauci was told it looked like one of the genomes was manipulated in a lab. Then the flurry of emails about, did we fund this, it seem like, that was my interpretation. Then, ""The Intercept"" and now, this.

Are you convinced that Dr. Fauci is not being honest with the American people?

REINCE PRIEBUS, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Absolutely. You know what they're going to try to do now, the next phase is going to be, they're going to say that we didn't give the money to the Wuhan lab, we gave the money to another entity that we get a gave a grant to that gave the money to the Wuhan lab.

But the grant-writing process is so detailed. so wildly cumbersome that it's impossible for the NIH not to know what they're doing. It's like forensic accounting times 10. The tracking, the monitoring, the reporting. The NIH lost control over this. They're lying, this Eco Health Company is lying. But you hit it too though, Sean, this is what happens when the media doesn't hold any of these folks accountable, Fauci, the NIH, and anyone that says anything different they're just labeled as a kook.

Bill Maher, I don't know if you saw this, but Bill Maher actually, believe it or not, we're using him as an example, but he pointed out something important. He said that ""The New York Times"" did a call and ""The New York Times"" found that when you asked people what are the odds of someone going to the hospital if they get COVID, and 40 percent of Democrats said 50 percent or more is likely to go to the hospital if you get COVID, which means that these people are being fed through liberal media a bunch of garbage.

And no one's holding either the NIH accountable, no one's holding Fauci accountable, but no one's holding the media accountable either. That's how we get to this point.

Jason, we now have Fauci's emails. We have the documents from the intercept that they made public. And now we have this new evidence. In your mind, does it -- is this case overwhelming, is it incontrovertible that Dr. Fauci knew a lot more about the origins of this virus and gain of function and where the money came from and that he was being deceptive to be kind before Congress and Rand Paul?

JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, Senator Paul was clearly right. Now, what should happen here is Dr. Fauci should be fired or he should be dismissed or he should he should retire. But none of that's going to happen.

And so what should happen is the Republicans in the United States Senate, I am sick and tired of them issuing press releases. Every single Republican in the United States Senate should sign a letter starting with Mitch McConnell and make a criminal referral to the district that has the jurisdiction there in Washington, D.C., to the U.S. attorney and demand that they do an investigation.

And they should also ask that Dr. Fauci take a leave of absence while that is happening. He should be put on administrative leave because he would be -- he is there and incentivized, if there is something wrong to cover up evidence. You would do this if there was a shooting involving a police officer, you would do this if there was an allegation of sexual harassment. In this case, there's an allegation that millions of people died.

And so why take the chance of having Dr. Fauci continue to stay in that position. Get rid of the guy. We don't believe him. America needs a second opinion. Get rid of Dr. Fauci. That's what has to happen. But Republicans must be united. None of these individual press releases.

HANNITY: All right. Jason, thank you. Reince Priebus, thank you.

When we come back, wow, Alec Baldwin accidentally shot, killed a crew member, injured another after a firing of what is known as a prop gun on the set of his new movie. Greg Jarrett, Geraldo Rivera are all here with the details, straight ahead.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HANNITY: Now we're learning even more details tonight following a shocking tragedy on the set of a movie that's being filmed that's called ""Rust"". Actor Alec Baldwin fatally shot the film's cinematographer, wounded the director after an apparent what they call a prop gun mishap on the set in New Mexico. Now, the victims have been identified as Halyna Hutchins years old the mother died on Thursday, and Joel Souza, 48, reportedly has now been released thankfully from the hospital. He is expected to make a full recovery.

According to the union that covers prop masters, the prop gun contained a live round. According to a new report, the bullet Alec Baldwin fired struck Hutchins then exited her body and then hit the director's clavicle. Here's a short clip of the 911 call.

(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)

CALLER: Two people have been shot accidentally.

(END AUDIO CLIP)

HANNITY: Now, earlier today, Baldwin broke his silence. He posted on Twitter, there are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchinson, a wife, mother, deeply admired colleague of ours, and added that he is fully cooperating with the police investigation.

But a story breaking from ""The L.A. Times"" tonight finds that just hours before this tragedy, at least a half dozen crew members walked off the set in protest of working conditions. Detectives are currently investigating how and what type of projectile was discharged. No charges have been filed at this time.

Here with reaction, FOX News correspondent at large Geraldo Rivera, and FOX News legal analyst Greg Jarrett.

All right. Geraldo, let me start with you -- the wars between me and Alec Baldwin don't factor into my opinion here. I want to be straightforward. I would be shocked -- I would be shocked if the evidence shows that in fact he did this on purpose. I don't believe that. I don't think that -- I don't think we're going to come to that conclusion.

Now, I believe in due process, the presumption of innocent and I believe we need a full forensic investigation. But I -- in my heart, it seems like, looks like a tragic accident. How did a live round get in to that weapon? Because it's really a gun, except it's supposed to fire blanks?

GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT AT LARGE: Right, Sean, but we're not clear whether the live round, the union, local 44, later clarified that by live round, they were not saying that it was a bullet. That it could have been a blank. But, you know, when you fire a blank, it leaves residue in the barrel of the gun. We know guns very well. If you -- if you don't clean the barrel out, you put another blank behind it and you fire that blank it can eject that that projectile what the remnants of what was in the barrel at sufficient velocity that it is bullet like.

But you mentioned charges, Sean, let me just say let's assume that this was just a tragic accident with the background of this labor turmoil and chaos on the set. Listen to the this definition of involuntary manslaughter. It involves a killing that occurs when the defendant is engaging in a lawful but dangerous act without exercising due caution and circumspection. The example they give is the driver who is texting and accidentally kills somebody. Involuntary manslaughter is a fourth degree felony in New Mexico punishable by up to 18 months in prison.

So this is very serious this is at the minimum okay this felony in the fourth degree. This is -- this is what Alec Baldwin or the props guy or girl may be facing, Sean.

HANNITY: All right, I listen very carefully, lawful but dangerous act without you know using due caution. I'm listening to those words carefully, Geraldo,

Gregg, I'll pick your legal mind here. Would it be the actor's role to take a prop gun and say, excuse me, can you assure me that that this is a blank and not a bullet?

GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: No, it's not his role, and if there's no evidence that he knew that there was a real bullet in the gun, then he would not be criminally charged. Unless it could be shown, Sean, that he was mishandling the gun in a grossly negligent or reckless way. The preliminary information we have doesn't indicate that, but law enforcement continues to investigate. There will certainly be a civil lawsuit for money damages alleging negligence. That's almost a given.

But, look, this sort of thing shouldn't happen because there are standard safety protocols in place on film sets involving licensed armorers who are there to provide, handle, maintain, check and double check and secure the weapon so nobody else has access to it before it is ever used.

So, the Baldwin might not be criminally charged. It is altogether possible based on gross negligence and recklessness as Geraldo has defined it under the New Mexico statute that somebody else in the film production could happen.

But this should never happen at all. It happened back in 1993 famously with the actor Brandon Lee. There was a fragment of a projectile lodged in the barrel and then when the blank was fired, it evicted it, killing him. That barrel should have been checked.

Now, if the D.A. say there's negligence here, but we -- it doesn't rise the level of criminal negligence, no charges were filed. But, of course --

(CROSSTALK)

JARRETT: There were criminal charges filed.

HANNITY: We only have a minute, I would be hard-pressed even though, Alec Baldwin hates me and I don't really like him, but I'd be hard-pressed to believe that he knew that this would happen. I want to see -- I want to see incontrovertible evidence. I don't -- this seems like a tragic accident, our prayers to the families here. It's so tragic.

RIVERA: But what if they fired the armorer, what if they fired the guy, the union guy, and didn't replace him? Baldwin is a producer on this movie. He's not only the star of the movie, he's also a producer. So if they -- if the union guys weren't there to take care of the weapons, as Greg defines taking care of the weapons, and they don't replace -- I mean, someone should have checked that barrel.

HANNITY: In this case, I look at the -- my initial thought, but we have to follow the forensics and the evidence. I don't see Alec doing something like this and I'm saying that as somebody that doesn't like the guy and he doesn't like me. I would be shocked beyond any imagination if he did.

I hope nobody -- I hope this was not intentional on anybody's part. Either way, we -- you know, we lost a mom, and apparently a wonderful woman.

Thank you both.

More HANNITY after this.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HANNITY: All right. Unfortunately, that is all the time we have left this evening. In the meantime, let not your heart be troubled. Stay tuned, the news continues this Friday night. Laura Ingraham is up next and we hope you have a great weekend."
2021-10-22,Anderson Cooper 360,CNN,Anderson Cooper,"ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Good evening. We begin tonight with breaking news and unanswered questions in the fatal shooting with a prop handgun on the set of an Alec Baldwin movie that wounded the film's director, Joel Souza and took the life of the Director of Photography, Halyna Hutchins.

It happened near Santa Fe, New Mexico. Baldwin himself pulled the trigger and harder than might be to believe, this is at least the third such deadly incident involving prop firearms.

In a moment, new word on working conditions on set specifically whether safety protocols were followed. We'll be joined by a ""Los Angeles Times"" writer who contributed to the reporting on that.

First though, the call to Santa Fe County 9-1-1, which was obtained by CNN affiliate KOAT, usual warnings about difficult content apply.

(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)

911 OPERATOR: Santa Fe Fire and EMS, what's the location of your emergency?

(END AUDIO CLIP)

COOPER: As we mentioned, there are many unanswered questions here as CNN's Lucy Kafanov is working the story for us, joins us now from Santa Fe -- Lucy.

LUCY KAFANOV, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Anderson we've been told that a search warrant has been issued for the Bonanza Creek Ranch where this incident took place. Sheriffs tell us that they'll be carefully combing through the property this weekend searching for clues and evidence they say that they do not expect to update us before Monday.

Now, the DA's Office say they don't know at this stage whether any charges will be filed as authorities try to piece together how this tragedy could have taken place.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

KAFANOV (voice over): Tonight, actor, Alec Baldwin says he is fully cooperating in the investigation into the fatal shooting on the set of the movie ""Rust.""

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Bonanza Creek Ranch. We've had two people accidentally shot.

KAFANOV (voice over): Officials say they are still in the initial stages of their investigation into what led to the fatal incident when Baldwin discharged a prop weapon on set.

Director Joe Souza rushed by ambulance to a local hospital with injuries. The film's director of photography, Halyna Hutchins was pronounced dead after being transported by a helicopter to the hospital. Police continued to interview witnesses and are looking into what type of projectile was fired from a prop gun commonly used on movie sets that aren't without their own risks.

JOSEPH FISHER, PROP MASTER ON MOVIE SETS: Prop weapons do have a dangerous factor to them, even though they're a lot safer than using live fire on onset.

KAFANOV (voice over): Forty-two-year-old Hutchins who posted on Instagram from the New Mexico location only days ago lived in Los Angeles with her husband and son and was credited in the production of dozens of film, TV, and video titles.

Today, Baldwin tweeting from the account he shares with his wife, ""There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins. I am in touch with her husband, offering my support to him and his family.""

These tragic accidents and movie sets have happened before after Brandon Lee, son of Bruce Lee was killed in 1993 on the set of the movie ""The Crow"" when a fragment of a dummy bullet became lodged in a prop gun, which fatally wounded Lee in the abdomen. Shannon Lee posting on her brother's verified Twitter account, ""Our hearts go out to the family of Halyna Hutchins and to Joe Souza, and all involved in the incident on 'Rust.' No one should ever be killed by a gun on a film set. Period.""

(END VIDEOTAPE)

COOPER: And Lucy, have we heard anything from the families of those who were shot?

KAFANOV: Not Joel Souza, who possibly is still in the hospital. We have heard from the husband of Halyna -- pardon me, Hutchins who spoke out to insiders saying quote: ""I don't think there are words to communicate the situation."" By all accounts the 42-year-old was a rising star in the film world, but also just in, Anderson, prior to Thursday's incident, prior to the shooting, there have been new news reports indicating that several crew members actually quit the production over concerns about safety, COVID safety procedures, but also apparently gun safety procedures.

These are according to reports by ""The LA Times"" and other media outlets. Obviously, we're trying to track that reporting in further detail -- Anderson.

COOPER: Lucy Kafanov, appreciate it.

We have more actually on that reporting tonight from ""The Los Angeles Times."" Here's a passage attributed by ""The Times"" that three people familiar with a matter who are not authorized to comment. I am quoting now from ""The LA Times,"" ""Safety protocol standard in the industry, including gun inspections were not strictly followed on the 'Rust' near Santa Fe, the sources said. They said at least one of the camera operators complained last weekend to production managers about gun safety on the set.""

Joining us now is ""LA Times"" writer, Anousha Sakoui. Anousha, thanks for being with us. What are you able to tell us based on your reporting about the on-site conditions?

ANOUSHA SAKOUI, WRITER, ""THE LOS ANGELES TIMES"": Yes, I just want to shout out my colleagues, Meg James and Amy Kaufman as well, who, you know, have been updating the story this afternoon. And we've all been sort of like, you know, all hands at it trying to confirm what's happened on this set.

The information is sparse, but what we've been able to confirm is that about half a dozen camera crew workers walked off just before, you know, hours before this incident happened. They had actually turned up that morning to collect their gear and had witnessed other -- according to our reporting -- others sort of non-union crew coming to sort of replace them, and that is sort of relevant because obviously when -- you know, a lot of Hollywood production is unionized, and with that comes certain training and qualifications and whatnot. And so that's one of the big things is that they -- the crew were

unhappy, part of the crew were unhappy walking off. Part of that was about gun safety, misfires that some of the crew have reported. And also, you know, being asked to drive 50 miles from Albuquerque to Santa Fe, which is something that is really a big issue for crew generally, which is adding to long days and tiredness.

COOPER: The -- was this a -- I assume this wasn't a big budget film. It sounds like they were sort of -- I mean, if they're telling the crew to drive, you know 50 miles, instead of staying in Santa Fe, I guess, to save money. Do you know about the budget?

SAKOUI: Yes, my understanding is that this is a low budget movie, probably just a few million dollars. We don't obviously have the exact numbers, and they fall under a different sort of category of contract that, you know, productions work on. Different with major movies and that, you know, that are made -- and TV shows in Hollywood.

Those require, you know -- major contracts require certain amount of rest between days and so forth, and actually earlier this week, you probably know there was going to be a strike over the terms of these contracts. That was called off because crew were offered by producers as part of a deal, you know, a guaranteed 54-hour break from what was zero.

So you can kind of get an idea of the working conditions. And, you know, to my understanding, these low budget productions are not necessarily having to adhere to the same kinds of protocols.

COOPER: I understand, you've learned more about the cinematographer who was killed and what she had been advocating for in terms of safety on the set.

SAKOUI: Yes, so Halyna Hutchins had been you know, as your reporter had said, a rising star and also, you know, rare to have a female cinematographer in the industry, you know, rising up and also doing genre films like a Western and she had apparently been advocating for safety on the shoot. And, you know, I guess felt alone or left behind by her crew, colleagues, and she sort of stayed, but she was obviously upset and in tears as had been reported by the situation before this fatal incident happened.

COOPER: It's just so awful for her family and everybody involved. Anousha, appreciate it. Anousha Sakoui, thank you.

[20:10:10]

COOPER: Joining us now is Larry Zanoff, who has 59 film and TV series to his name. He is a gun handler armorer. Also with us, because of all the questions this raises potentially about civil and criminal liability, CNN legal analyst Laura Coates.

Larry, I appreciate your time tonight. This is obviously still an ongoing investigation. There are limited details we have, just in layman's terms, can you then walk us through how prop guns are usually handled on film sets and the safety guidelines that should go along with them?

LARRY ZANOFF, HOLLYWOOD WEAPONS EXPERT: Of course. In the television and film industry, the safety guidelines and protocols when handling firearms are governed by safety bullet number one, the correct recommendations for handling of firearms and blank ammunition on set. That gives us all of the guidelines required for what we do with the guns, how we handle them, how they're stored, as well as the blank ammunition, all the protocols as well.

They are very stringent protocols. The firearms are always under the control of the prop master or someone designated by the prop master and that is usually the armorer to be responsible for the firearms when they're on set.

COOPER: And I mean, have you come across scenarios where projectiles of some kind are found in prop guns, even if the prop gun has whatever -- you know, whatever they have that that makes it look like it's firing a real bullet, is that something that can become a projectile?

ZANOFF: Yes. I have not personally myself come across a situation like that. And of course, as you mentioned earlier, we really don't know yet exactly what the situation was. So, I hesitate to speculate on that at this time.

COOPER: What is normally in a prop gun?

ZANOFF: Usually, if you see gunfire on set, it's a firearm that is set up to shoot blanks. A blank is a form of cartridge where in the real world that cartridge would include a bullet or a projectile, which is the part that goes flying downrange. A blank does not have that projectile.

By design, it is created so that we can simulate gunfire. You can get the audible bang, you can get smoke and some flash coming out the muzzle, but no projectile is propelled downrange.

COOPER: And Laura, you heard this ""LA Times"" reporting about alleged concerns among some crew members about safety on set. Again, we have no idea if that has any impact on what occurred. If it's accurate, I mean, what are the potential legal liabilities here?

LAURA COATES, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: You know what a tragedy. It's so unfortunate to even be talking about this. But when I hear the words about complaints, the immediate legal term that comes in my mind is notice -- that somebody was on notice about safe or unsafe working conditions. And if that's the case, it can trigger a whole range of things in terms of civil liability, in terms of who was in charge and making sure that the workplace was safe, that whatever safety protocols should have been enforced or implemented were in fact followed.

And if complaints were told or said that indicate that there was a lapse of either due care or the normal course of due care you're supposed to expect, then you have issues.

You also have, frankly, on the criminal side, nobody wants to try to introduce that. We understand why it's not -- you know, we don't know anything in terms of the intent or anything, but the law does recognize the idea of there can be some liability even in the case of an accident.

Now, New Mexico does have a code, a statute that talks about excusable homicide -- homicide, meaning death at the hands of another person. It doesn't necessarily mean intentional murder or premeditation, which we don't have any indications occurred here. But if it's a matter of misfortune they're talking about or accident, as long as the person was engaged in an otherwise lawful act and they exercise, the due care that you would ordinarily expect, then you do have some ways to alleviate that liability.

But there are so many concerns that have been raised, the reasons you've given, but really it comes down to what was known, what protocols were actually followed, and whether due care was actually used.

COOPER: Larry, with a prop gun, is there a certain distance between actors that is advised, you know, if it's going to be fired? Also, if even if it's not in a scene, would an actor under the rules be handed a prop gun to just kind of hold on to or even during rehearsal hold on to?

ZANOFF: Yes, so as far as the minimum safety distance goes, it's not advised, it is mandated. Part of the protocols mandate that there's a minimum 20 foot safety distance between the muzzle and anything that could be harmed by any potential hazard.

COOPER: Twenty feet. Wow.

[20:15:12]

ZANOFF: Due to the blank gun -- now, there is a lot of different ways that you can film a scene. You can do it with long lenses where the camera is actually much further away than 20 feet. If you, for whatever reason, had to be within 20 feet, you could put up a physical barrier, in other words, a sheet of Lexan that can actually separate the muzzle from anything that's in the danger zone of that 20 feet. So there's a lot of different possibilities there.

As far as an actor not being in the scene, handling a weapon, if the gun is not in front of camera and it's not ready to be used in front of camera, it should be secured by the prop master or someone designated by the prop master and that is usually the armor and then just before the scene is filmed, the guns would be returned to the actors.

COOPER: Larry Zanoff, I appreciate your expertise and I'm sorry that it's needed tonight in this circumstance. Thank you so much. And Laura Coates as well, thank you.

All right, up next, there is breaking news in the January 6th investigation where the central pusher of the big lie and a key figure in the scheme to overturn the election now has a date to testify. Later, new reporting on Facebook and January 6th, what the company's

own analysis reveals about how it failed to halt the growth of the movement dedicated to the election lie.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[20:20:38]

COOPER: There is breaking news tonight about the senior Justice Department official the former President was scheming with to overturn the election. In fact, he nearly named Jeffrey Clark, acting Attorney General the highest law enforcement official in the land and was only stopped when faced with the threat of mass resignations in the Department of Justice.

Now two sources familiar with the House Select Committee's investigation say Clark will testify a week from today. This comes at the end of the day that also saw a Federal judge set a November 4th hearing date on the former President's executive privilege claim on January 6th related documents.

More now in all of this from CNN's Evan Perez who joins us from the Capitol. So, what more do we know about Clark testifying before the committee?

EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Anderson, this is -- he is going to be testifying as a result of the subpoena that the Committee issued. His former bosses Jeffrey Rosen, Rich Donoghue, the former Attorney General -- Deputy Attorney General at the time, they testified voluntarily, and so this testimony, which we expect to happen next week really will give this committee a window into a central character of that drama that happened in those days, those key days, the end of December, early January, when Trump was trying to get the Justice Department to weigh in on his side and these baseless claims that there was fraud in various states.

And so we know that Clark was having conversations with Trump. One of the things the Committee wants to know is who was he working with, besides Donald Trump himself? Some of the legal things that he was trying to do, some of the legal documents that he came up with, was he working with others inside the U.S. government? Was he working with people outside? Those are the questions that are at the top of the mind of the members of this Committee.

COOPER: What about the upcoming hearing in the former President's executive privilege claim? Is there any expectation on that?

PEREZ: Well, yes, so this is going to be a big hearing, Anderson, because I mean, look, after five years, you know, we keep talking about the norms that Trump broke. This is another example of this. Donald Trump is going to go to court claiming that he has the right to intervene and try to stop some documents from being produced from the National Archives to the January 6th Committee.

The current holder of the office, Joe Biden has waived privilege on this set of documents and we have not really had a legal fight like this before. And so we're going to see what this judge does. We expect, probably that Donald Trump will lose at least in the first round, but it's not going to be over then. You can bet that he is going to try to appeal and we'll see what -- how this shakes out.

COOPER: Evan Perez, appreciate it.

There is new reporting in AXIOS outlining the extreme likelihood of the former President being the 2024 Republican nominee, CNN political analyst and AXIOS Managing Editor, Margaret Talev shares the byline. Also with us tonight, CNN senior political analyst, David Gergen, advisor for Presidents of both parties since the Nixon administration.

Margaret, I want to ask you about some of your latest reporting that the former President is thinking seriously about running again, even going so far as to tell some of the people around him that he is running. Can you just talk about more of what you've learned?

MARGARET TALEV, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, Anderson, I mean, I don't know whether Donald Trump is actually going to run again, whether he could actually get elected again, given that he is still perpetuating a lie that the election was stolen, and given his role on January 6th, but Mike Allen and I are hearing from people close to the President now that there has been a shift since the end of the summer until now that they now believe it is definitely more than 50 percent likely.

And another person told me this week that if Republicans win the Senate as well as the House next year, this could be irresistible to President Trump.

COOPER: And, David, what do you make of that?

DAVID GERGEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think the signs are just as Margaret says. They are saying that he is increasingly interested. Strikingly, Anderson, his interest seems to intensify when he sees Biden in trouble.

During the Afghanistan situation, he was really chomping at the bit. According to various reports, he had to be talked out of it. And now with Biden's approval rating sinking down into the low 40s and the economy still not straightening out, and the pandemic still not over, you know, that just makes Trump very, very hungry.

I think it's going to take something usually unexpected or a dramatic change in his health or a prison sentence to stop him.

COOPER: And Margaret, the former President has been obviously endorsing, you know, loyalists who back his fraud claims around the country. He is still clearly pushing the big lie. That would -- I assume be part of his campaign. He can't stop talking about it and pushing it. Is there any sign that it's cost him politically?

[20:25:17]

TALEV: You know, there is new polling this week, the latest Quinnipiac poll shows more than three-fourth, it is almost eight in 10 Republicans who say they want Trump to win. It's very early. It's too early to read anything really lasting into poll numbers.

If you look at the overall numbers, a majority of Americans definitely do not want him to run again, and a majority of Independents even are against it. But that's not what primaries are about. Primaries are about the base and there are a couple of other factors.

David is right. All these things -- Afghanistan, bad jobs numbers, Biden's numbers going underwater, but there are a couple of other things to watch. One is the acceleration of this January 6th Committee. One is out at his own rally in Iowa, and the last part that I will keep an eye on is the really intense Republican anger around both the school masking rules and what is happening with the backlash against public schools teaching really anything about racism that gets put under this umbrella of critical race theory, but it's not about illegal theory, it is lessons teaching children about the modern day impacts of the legacy of racism that these have been galvanizing forces and that Trump sees different opportunities, a different window for what a 2024 run could look like.

COOPER: Your reporting also some really interesting information about Mike Pence.

TALEV: Yes. Yes. Look, obviously Trump is keeping an eye on everyone who could be competition for him. Is it Ron DeSantis? Is it Mike Pompeo? We know it's not Nikki Haley. She's already said if he is on the ballot, she's not going to run.

But Mike Pence notably has not said that and Donald Trump is paying attention. Could Mike Pence beat Donald Trump at a primary? No Republican that I talked to thinks so. But could he make it really interesting? And what would he say? He was the Vice President and an extreme loyalist until this breaking point around January the 6th, and even now, he is careful in his critique and his criticism and the way he talks about it.

So where is this all going? I don't know. But this is a subject of actually intense interest among Trump and his allies.

COOPER: Yes. I'm sure -- I mean, David, can you imagine Mike Pence running if the former President is running? I mean, that seems hard to imagine.

GERGEN: No, no, no, it does. It would be -- wouldn't it be a dramatic contest that all of us would follow with great interest? It would have almost Shakespearean qualities to it.

But Mike Pence and his various pronouncements has made it pretty clear, he doesn't really care what Trump's going to do. He's going to do what he wants to do. And if Trump gets in, fine. He obviously would prefer him not to get in.

I would also, Anderson suggest, it is time keep an eye on the Republicans in the Senate. There are many anti-Trump rebellion that is happening there of senators who are really worried about losing the Senate if this race can be turned to contest about Trump himself for Trump versus Biden. And it may be that after a long, long period in which all these Republicans have been held hostage by Trump that a few influential people will follow McConnell and start challenging him.

TALEV: It is interesting, you know, we talk about what impact it would have on turnout for 2022 that Trump isn't on the ballot, but I think in a sense he is. His allies say he is much more likely to run if Republicans win back both chambers, and we haven't seen it yet, but I think we'll see whether Democrats are going to start really leaning into that argument to try to turn out their voters next year.

COOPER: Interesting. Margaret Talev, fascinating reporting, thank you. David Gergen, as always, thank you.

Breaking news on dissent within Facebook in the wake of the insurrection, what some inside Facebook were saying about the company's culpability leading up to the attack on democracy.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[20:32:39]

COOPER: Busy night, more breaking news what CNN has learned from internal Facebook documents about how the company fell short in tamping down the so-called Stop The Steal movement that culminated in violence on January 6. Facebook spokespeople as you know have touted their effort but now we're learning from these documents that internally, it was viewed as a different story.

CNN's Donie O'Sullivan has the report.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On January 6, Facebook executives condemned the attack on the U.S Capitol, but internally, some employees began to push back. Facebook they suggested was culpable one writing an internal Facebook company chat, all due respect, but haven't we had enough time to figure out how to manage discourse without enabling violence. We've been fueling this fire for a long time and we shouldn't be surprised it's now out of control. Another wrote, they were tired of thoughts and prayers from Facebook leadership. There were dozens of stop the steal groups active up until yesterday and that her Facebook employee responded.

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKERS: Stop that steal, stop that steal.

O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): Stop the steal, the conspiracy theory movement that helped fuel the insurrection had been organizing on Facebook for months.

(on-camera): How did you guys hear about this event today?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Through facebook.

O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): Facebook events, Instagram, how have you been?

SCOTT PRESLER, STOP THE STEAL ORGANIZER: Yes. Well, I created a Facebook event for yesterday's event. And I posted after the fact that we were again coming today I will be again making another event in regards to tomorrow.

JOAN DONOVAN, RESEARCH DIRECTOR, HARVARD SHORENSTEIN CENTNER ON MEDIA, POLITICS & PUBLIC POLICY: Facebook provided the fundamental coordinating infrastructure, they were sharing ride share information, they were sharing resources they were talking about, you know what they were going to wear and if they were going to have Trump flags.

O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): We now know that an internal Facebook report describes the company's attempts to crack down and Stop The Steal as piecemeal. That document leaked by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who spent her final months at the company photographing thousands of internal documents and company chat logs.

DONOVAN: These documents are vindication that what we've been saying as a field has been true all along, and that Facebook knows it and could take action on it and decides not too.

LAWRENCE LESSIG, ADVISOR TO FACEBOOK WHISTLEBLOWER FRANCES HAUGEN: For many years, people have been talking about the Facebook effect what Facebook is doing to culture to society to politics, but we didn't really know from data from Facebook, whether these theories were true. What Frances has given us is an extraordinary archive of material that helps us see exactly what's going on and what they know is going on. And it is the biggest and most important contribution to understanding this incredibly important problem that we've ever had.

[20:35:24]

O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): The leaked documents many just becoming public were given to a consortium of news organizations, including CNN formed the basis of a complaint to the SEC, where Haugen alleges the company misled investors and the public about its role perpetuating misinformation, and violent extremism relating to the 2020 election and January 6, insurrection.

(on-camera): Facebook executives, like Nick Clegg will say, it's unfair to blame Facebook, for the insurrection.

DONOVAN: It's a red herring to say people are blaming Facebook for the entire thing. That's not what's happening here. And you can't at the same time be Facebook and trying to take responsibility and being very proud of all the organizing work that you've helped Black Lives Matter do or the Occupy Movements or Standing Rock, you can't take credit for all of that, and then say, oh, that thing called the insurrection we had nothing to do with that.

O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): Another revelation from the documents an internal memo, including details of a Facebook staffer setting up a test account to see what Facebook's algorithms were recommending to users.

Two thousand nineteen, a Facebook employee sets up an account designed to look like a 41-year-old conservative mom living in North Carolina. Her name is Carolyn Smith. She likes a few pages. She likes Trump. She likes Fox News. But in a week, she's getting a QAnon recommendation. I saw in there, that after three weeks, there was actually a recommendation for a page that was the three percenters the militia, self-described militia involved in the insurrection.

LESSIG: Yes, no, I mean, again, we've suspected this dynamic.

O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): Yes.

LESSIG: What's striking about what Frances has revealed, is that we now know that Facebook itself saw this precisely. So these are like potato chips that they feed to somebody who's got a potato chip addiction, and that is the reality of the platform. It is an addiction engine, and it profits, the more it can manipulate us to consume what we want to consume most.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

COOPER: Donie, how is Facebook responded?

O'SULLIVAN: Hey, Anderson. Yes, Facebook, stressing that it wasn't just them, right? A lot of this stuff the Stop The Steal content, of course, was on Twitter and YouTube too. Specifically here's a statement from a company spokesperson Andy Stone, he said the notion that the January 6 insurrection would not have happened, but for Facebook, it's absurd. The former president push a narrative that the election was stolen, including in person a short distance from the Capitol building that day. The responsibility for the violence lies with those who attacked our Capitol and those who encouraged them, he says Facebook has a long track record of cooperation with law enforcement, including the agencies responsible for addressing threats of domestic terrorism.

But Anderson, I just want to highlight there from that report. I mean, what's really remarkable and what really is insightful about all of this is that test account, Facebook itself set up as a 41-year-old conservative mom living in North Carolina in the summer of 2019 liked a few conservative pages on Facebook within a week was being dragged down a QAnon rabbit hole, and within three weeks was being recommended pages about the tree percenter militia.

COOPER: Fascinating. Donie O'Sullivan, appreciate it as always.

Up next, the latest on the identification of Brian Laundrie's remains, will investigators be able to determine a cause of death.

Plus, new information from the family attorney who says he spoke with Laundrie before he vanished.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[20:42:32]

COOPER: As you know the search is over for Brian Laundrie but there are more questions about that after the discovery of his remains this week in a Florida Preserve. Laundrie vanished last month of course after his fiance Gabby Petito's reported missing but before she was found strangled to death and Wyoming.

Now, the Laundrie family attorneys revealing some details while investigators trying to determine how Laundrie died.

Our Randi Kaye joins us now from North port Florida. So, talk about some new information you have about conversations Laundrie had before he disappeared.

RANDI KAYE, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well Anderson, I spoke with the Laundrie family attorney tonight Steve Bertolino, and he confirmed to me that he had two conversations with Brian Laundrie before Brian disappeared. Those took place on September 12th and September 13th. Remember Gabby was reported missing on September 11th. So these are key dates in the investigation. And then on the 13th is when Brian disappeared.

I asked him what took place during those conversations, what was said, he said that was privileged information and he could not tell me, Anderson.

COOPER: What's the latest on the investigation?

KAYE: Well, right now we don't have a cause of death. But we do know from the family attorney that Brian's remains have been sent to a forensic anthropologist, remember these were just skeletal remains they were bones he was identified by dental records. So, this type of expert will really study these bones and hopefully come up with a cause of death and even a time of death because the family lawyer is also saying that he had discussed with Brian's parents the possibility that Brian took his own life. So of course Anderson, they are looking for some answers.

COOPER: And is anything known about Brian Laundrie state of mind before he disappeared?

KAYE: Well, there are some clues possibly in this notebook that was found along with his remains and some personal belongings. We know from a source close to the investigation telling me that this notebook is possibly salvageable. We don't know what's in it, but it's possible that he wrote something to give an indication of his state of mind or maybe about something that he had or hadn't done. The parents are not talking about Brian Laundrie state of mind, but the lawyer is he spoke to WABC, and he was asked about Brian's state of mind, and this is what he said.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

STEVE BERTOLINO, LAUNDRIES ATTORNEY: Chris and Roberta knew that their son, Brian was grieving. They knew he was so upset. And, you know, they just couldn't control that he was leaving and he left he walked out the door, and Chris has said to me I wish I could have stopped them but I couldn't.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KAYE: And the timing of this is key because if he was grieving on September 13th, remember there hadn't been a homicide reported yet, Gabby Petito's remains hadn't been found yet. So what was he grieving about? What did he know? And what did he share with his parents? [20:45:11]

The family lawyer was asked about that on Good Morning America this morning, what if anything, Brian Laundrie had told his parents, and here's what he said.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BERTOLINO: That's not something I can comment on right now. And I'd like to just leave it at that.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well if you can't comment on it means you know something about it.

BERTOLINO: Well, I think everybody out there knows that, you know, whether the family or myself have some information to share, but you know, there's not much we can say at this point in time.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KAYE: And the Laundrie family lawyer was asked on Good Morning America if the Laundrie parents had any message for the Petito family, and he said, we have absolutely nothing to say with respect to the Gabby Petito incident. Anderson back to you.

COOPER: Randi, appreciate it.

Quick programming note, join Randi later tonight for an in depth look at the Gabby Petito investigation. The ""CNN SPECIAL REPORT GABBY PETITO AND THE HUNT FOR JUSTICE"" is on at 11:00 p.m. Eastern tonight.

Coming up, what Pfizer is saying about the efficacy of its vaccine for children ages five to 11. And a private school in Florida, where students who get a COVID shot are told to stay home for 30 days. Experts say that doesn't make sense.

Next, what our Gary Tuchman discovered when he talked with parents

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[20:50:19]

COOPER: Pfizer has released new data showing its COVID vaccine is 90 -- 90.7% effective against symptomatic COVID in children ages five to 11. On Tuesday, an FDA advisory committee is scheduled to meet to discuss whether the agency should grant emergencies authorization for the shots for that age group. Children 12 and older can already get it.

And for those students at one Miami private school strange vaccine mandate is in place. Any student who gets a shot must stay home for 30 days. The problem is it's based on bogus claims. The Florida Department of Education has sent a letter to school officials telling them they should review their policies and conform to Florida law.

Our Gary Tuchman has more on the controversy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

GARY TUCHMAN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Oscar Ascanio has a son who goes to Miami Centner Academy.

OSCAR ASCANIO, CENTNER ACADEMY PARENT: Well, you know, I think he's a family decision. And we should respect you know, like everybody privacy.

TUCHMAN (on-camera): It is a family decision, but it makes everyone safer because so many people have gotten the vaccinations, tens of thousands of people are not dying.

ASCANIO: There's a lot of people who get the vaccine and is dying right now.

TUCHMAN (on-camera): That's not true.

ASCANIO: No, it is true.

TUCHMAN (on-camera): No, it's not.

ASCANIO: Fox News says the truth.

TUCHMAN (on-camera): Fox News as a shoe but that's definitely not true. It's false. That's the problem.

ASCANIO: Fox News is the one that you can get, you know, like --

TUCHMAN (on-camera): Let me just tell you, sir, the greatest scientists in the world know that this vaccine is saving life. So my question for you --

ASCANIO: (INAUDIBLE) is not the best scientists in the world. That's just my opinion, you know.

TUCHMAN (on-camera): Yes, you're hearing bad information, sir. But with all due respect, I wish you good health.

ASCANIO: Thank you so much, same to you. Have a great day.

TUCHMAN (on-camera): Thank you.

(voice-over): Alex Serrano has three children who go to the school.

(on-camera): When you got the letter that said the children would have to stay home for 30 days if they got the vaccine. Did you say to yourself, I'm glad they sent that out?

ALEX SERRANO, CENTNER ACADEMY PARENT: Yes. And I sent an e-mail to the owners of the school saying that I'm in complete support of the policy and thanking them for it.

TUCHMAN (voice-over): Parents here say the letter banning vaccinated children from returning to school for 30 days also declared that children who get the vaccine could potentially transmit COVID to other children, which is certainly not true. The school released a statement saying the policy as a prudent precautionary measure. The owners of the school or a woman named Leila Centner and her husband David Centner. This spring after Leila Cetner sent out another email declaring that teachers who get vaccinated can't come here, the students. She told CNN --

LEILA CENTNER, CO-FOUNDER, CENTNER ACADEMY: There were all sorts of evidence and stories that came out that said potentially unvaccinated people are being impacted by being around vaccinated people.

TUCHMAN (voice-over): There is no such evidence.

The Centner Academy has one building for preschool students and kindergarteners, a separate building for first through eighth graders. Most of the students aren't yet eligible for vaccines, but they soon will be. One child who soon will be is the daughter of this woman.

(on-camera): You are very relieved she's not in that school anymore.

IRIS ACOSTA-ZOBEL, FMR CENTNER ACADEMY PARENT: Very relieved.

TUCHMAN (voice-over): Iris Acosta-Zobel, and her husband pulled their first grade daughter out of the Centner Academy last spring without getting any of their tuition back. Because they got more and more scared of the increasing anti-vax and anti-mask views at the school.

ZOBEL: The school encouraged the students to take their mask off.

TUCHMAN (on-camera): And they told your daughter, your six-year-old daughter take your mask off.

ZOBEL: Yep.

TUCHMAN (on-camera): And did your daughter tell you about that?

ZOBEL: She told me and she says, why -- you know why are you teaching me this but the school is saying this? So --

TUCHMAN (on-camera): It must have been infuriating.

ZOBEL: It was a very stressful time.

TUCHMAN (voice-over): The Academy is a non denominational school. Records from the Federal Election Commission do show that both Leila and David Centner donated very large amounts of money to Republican candidates and organizations. For example, both of them made separate donations to the Trump victory committee in 2020. Their donations, a half million dollars apiece. Leila Centner is active on social media conspiracy theories on her Instagram account, including this strange one declaring they told us the sun will give you skin cancer, but in reality, the sun prevents skin cancer. Of course that's untrue. Neither Centner would agree to talk to us this time around.

But some of the parents we talked with the school say they respect and admire her. However many parents have pulled their children out there respect if it ever existed, gone. ZOBEL: You don't indoctrinate, you educate. And much of what's happening there is an indoctrination that follows her beliefs.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

COOPER: And Gary joins us now. So the letter I mentioned from the Florida Department of Education that was sent to the school, what's the school's response.

TUCHMAN: So the Department of Education told the school that it needs to respond to Anderson, my five o'clock Eastern Time today drum roll it does not appear the school responded. I can tell you that Department of Education says its investigation will be thorough.

If it shows that student rights were violated, they say the school could be punished which could include the stripping of scholarship funding. And as of now, there's no evidence at all. No public evidence that the school is worried. Anderson.

[20:55:05]

COOPER: All right, Gary, thanks.

Up next, the Supreme Court's decision to act with some but not all deliberate speed on the new Texas law banning abortions after six weeks.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

COOPER: The Supreme Court today said November 1st to hear challenged the Texas law barring abortions after just six weeks before many women even know they're pregnant. In setting a day just 10 days away, the court acted quickly whoever did not put the law on hold leading Justice Sonia Sotomayor to write in a stinging dissent to the decision, quote, the impact is catastrophic. I cannot capture the totality of this harm in these pages.

Justice Sotomayor pointed out that even though the court had agreed to fast track oral arguments that would offer quote, cold comfort to women in Texas seeking abortion care.

Just last month the court agreed to allow the law to go into effect in a divided five to four order, release late at night on the courts emergency docket.

2021-10-22,Amanpour,CNN,Christiane Amanpour,"CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: Hello, everyone, and welcome to AMANPOUR.

Here's what's coming up.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We will, in fact, get to net zero emissions on electric power by 2035.

AMANPOUR: But can he get it done? America's climate credibility on the line, as President Biden wrestles with his own party ahead of that major

summit in Glasgow.

Then:

HENRY KISSINGER, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We are here to put an end to drift, confusion, retreat, and weakness.

AMANPOUR: ""Master of the Game"" author, diplomat Martin Indyk joins us on Henry Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East and lessons for

today.

Plus:

MAX BOOT, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: We can't count on Republicans to uphold our democracy.

AMANPOUR: Longtime conservative columnist and historian Max Boot tells Walter Isaacson he believes his former party poses a major threat to

democracy.

And finally:

PAULA REGO, ARTIST: I'm really married to my pictures.

AMANPOUR: Paula Rego and her fears barrier-breaking art. Nick Willing joins me to talk about his mother's work and life.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

AMANPOUR: Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.

The prestige of the United States is on the line. Those are the words of President Joe Biden in an appeal to his own party, as Senator Joe Manchin

of West Virginia continues to block the signature part of Biden's climate legislation.

And this comes ahead of two important summits, where the U.S. will be expected to put forward bold climate commitments. In a CNN town hall, the

president has hinted that money which was going to be used to push the country's power sector to go green could instead be reallocated to other

climate programs.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BIDEN: The negotiation is, I have been saying to, Joe, look, I will take - - if we don't do it in terms of the electric grid piece, what we would do is, give me that $150 billion. I'm going to add it to be able to do other

things that allow me to do things that don't directly affect the electric grid in the way that there's a penalty, but allow me to spend the money to

set new technologies in place.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: We're going to break all this down because the stakes could not be higher.

The U.N. is warning that fossil fuel production by the world's major economies is -- quote -- ""dangerously out of sync with limiting the

planet's warming to just 1.5 degrees.""

So will the president be able to get it done? Can the world's second largest polluter, the United States, come good on its climate goals?

Joining me now is Leah Stokes, professor of climate and energy policy at U.C. Santa Barbara.

Welcome to the program.

So, Leah, I don't know where to start. Should we start with, what is this signature, as President Biden calls it, the electric grid piece? And what

is the significance of it being opposed and maybe being discarded?

LEAH STOKES, U.C. SANTA BARBARA: Sure.

So there was a provision called the Clean Electricity Performance Program. It moved out of committee in the House and was expected to pass the House.

But, unfortunately, Senator Manchin said that he does not want to move forward with that policy.

And what it would have done is clean up our electricity system, in line with President Biden's goal, which was to commit to 100 percent clean

electricity by 2035. It would have said to each electric utility in the country, you need to get 4 percentage points cleaner every year. We need to

move faster, because, the last year, we only did 2.3 percentage points, and that was the best year we have ever had.

And if utilities did not move fast enough, what it would have done is say, you have to pay a penalty. So what President Biden is saying is that we

need to take the $150 billion that was supposed to go to that program and reallocate it within the power sector towards investments that keep us

moving in the right direction, but also in other parts of our economy to make sure that the package is going to cut pollution.

Because the thing to note is that that $150 billion was a quarter of the climate spending, and the program was going to deliver one-third of the

pollution cuts. So we have to figure out, how are we going to fill that hole both in terms of spending and pollution cuts?

[13:05:04]

AMANPOUR: Well, how do you think they -- it looks like they're negotiating now with Joe Manchin over that $150 billion.

I mean, that's what the president said in that clip, that they can reallocate this to other green energy programs. Can they? And would they be

as effective as this -- the one you have just outlined?

STOKES: Yes, I think that the White House needs to stay laser-focused on the climate crisis.

They have a commitment to cut carbon pollution 50 percent this decade. And that puts us on path to these Paris agreement targets of limiting warming

by 1.5 degrees. So, we have to cut that carbon pollution by 50 percent this decade.

And with that program not being part of the package, we have got that hole of about one-third of the carbon pollution. So what we need is for the

White House and leaders, like Majority Leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi, to figure out how they're going to deliver those pollution cuts.

And it can't just be in other sectors of the economy. It has to be in the power sector as well. Like President Biden was saying in the clip you

played, we can have the incentive side of the program. We could invest in cleaning up our electricity grid. And that's really important, because the

way to clean up our economy is by having clean electricity power, our homes, and our cars and even parts of heavy industry.

AMANPOUR: This is what President Biden, Joe Biden, said about Joe Manchin, repeatedly name-checking him during this important town hall, calling him a

friend, and essentially laying out Manchin's singular opposing -- why he opposes this thing, particularly for his state. Let's just take a listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BIDEN: Joe Manchin's argument is: Look, we still have coal in my state. You're going to eliminate it eventually. We know it's going away. We know

it's going to be gone, but don't rush it so fast that my people don't have anything to do.

I think that's not what we should be doing. But the fact of the matter is, we can take that $150 billion, add it to the $320 billion that's in the law

now that he's prepared to support for tax incentives, tax incentives, to have people act in a way that they're going to be able to do the things

that need to be do...

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: So, again, he's talking about that -- his signature deal and what to do with the other $150 billion -- or that $150 billion.

I want to ask you, because you talked about one-third, two-thirds. So as you rightly say this think tank Energy Innovation says that even without

the CEPP, there would be two-thirds of emissions cut down, even if that one-third isn't. Is that good enough? Can the U.S., can the world live with

that?

STOKES: Unfortunately, climate change doesn't work that way. You can't solve two-thirds of the problem and call it a success.

And that's because we actually have to limit warming. We have seen what one degrees of Celsius of warming looks like. It looks like the United States

spending half-a-trillion dollars almost on weather and climate disasters last year alone.

So if we're talking about investing over half-a-trillion dollars over 10 years to stop the problem, that's really a drop in the bucket compared to

the costs of climate inaction. And so, no, we actually need the package to use every single dollar that was allocated towards climate spending.

And we need to make sure we have a plan to cut carbon pollution 50 percent by 2030, which is what President Biden has promised he will deliver.

AMANPOUR: So, just to be clear, could they still meet their targets, even without the CEPP part of it?

STOKES: I think that they can. And that's really what leaders in Congress and the White House are focused on right now. And we need to keep that

pressure up to make sure that they deliver those pollution cuts.

There are other ways we can save pollution. We can, for example, as President Biden said, have incentives in the power sector, where we say,

hey, if states are going to move faster on cleaning up their electricity systems, let's provide them with resources to help them move faster.

We can say that, in the industrial sector, let's have programs to invest in cleaning up our heavy industries, like cement and steel. Let's have

programs to help people in their homes get rid of gas in their stoves and their furnaces, so that we can use cleaner electricity in our homes

instead.

The president has to figure out a plan for how he's going to redeploy that $150 billion and deliver the same pollution cuts that we were going to have

before Senator Manchin killed the signature part of the climate bill.

AMANPOUR: And what do you think this does?

[13:10:00]

I mean, you focus on policy over these issues. And this is coming barely a week before the Glasgow COP 26 climate conference. What effect will this

have on America's credibility? The president himself is going there with all his top climate officials.

STOKES: Well, I think that this is what's on everybody's minds.

The White House really needs to deliver on its climate promise. It said that it was going to put us on a path to cutting carbon pollution 50

percent this decade. And it also said that we would get to 80 percent clean power by 2030 and 100 percent clean power by 2035.

And so we need to redeploy that $150 billion to deliver on the pollution cuts and deliver on cleaning up our electricity system this decade. It

doesn't have to be with sticks. It can be with carrots, as President Biden is saying. But we really do need investments in our power sector to take on

the climate crisis.

AMANPOUR: OK, so that's interesting, because the big one, the clean energy one that we have been talking about, involves sticks and carrots or carrots

and sticks.

And, as you said, it involves punitive measures if those companies don't do what they are meant to do under that program. I understand that the others

that are being discussed are voluntary. They don't have any punitive measures or those kinds of really intense incentives to actually go green

in time.

STOKES: That is true. But that doesn't mean that they're not effective.

If we were to put $150 billion into decarbonizing our grid, that would make a difference. If we were to say to states, hey, let's compete against one

another to make progress, to make sure our grid is reliable, to avoid things like what happened in Texas earlier this year, where the grid really

got destabilized because investments were not made in our electricity system, we can invest in this program -- in this problem and make really

big progress, not just on decarbonization and cleaning up our grid for climate change, but also in making sure that our grid is reliable, and can

deliver as we deal with more weather and climate disasters.

AMANPOUR: And briefly and finally, many people in the policy sphere and in the climate sphere believe that nothing short of a carbon tax is actually

going to solve the issue of going green in time to cut the emissions in time and all of the things we have been hearing about.

Do you think that's a total likelihood in these negotiations, or will these negotiations lead to that?

STOKES: Well, Senator Manchin already said I believe on Tuesday this week that a carbon tax was not on the table. So I don't think that is what's

being discussed.

What we are talking about are investments in industrial pollution, in the power sector, in our buildings. How can we redeploy that $150 billion to

deliver on President Biden's promises to clean up the grid this decade, and to cut our carbon pollution economy-wide in half by 2030?

AMANPOUR: Leah Stokes, thank you so much indeed for joining us.

Now the groundbreaking soldier statesman former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, as we know, died this week, and he played an instrumental

role in shaping military and foreign policy over the course of his four decades in public service. And he was the first black secretary of state

and broke so many frontiers.

Another paragon of U.S. diplomacy, who, like Powell, also attained celebrity status, is one of his predecessors, Henry Kissinger. A new book

by Martin Indyk, ""Master of the Game,"" Looks at Kissinger's role in the Middle East and what we can learn from his political philosophy.

Indyk is a former U.S. ambassador to Israel and the former special envoy for the Israeli Palestinian peace negotiations in the Clinton and Obama

administrations. And he's joining me now.

Welcome back to the program, Martin Indyk.

I guess my first question is, why Henry Kissinger? Why did you decide to pick this man, who, as you know, is controversial -- there are many people

who don't approve of quite a lot of his foreign policy -- and use him as this, I guess, sort of watermark for the Middle East and for other

important international policy?

MARTIN INDYK, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL: Well, I think a lot of people don't know that Kissinger actually spent the four years of his time

as secretary of state working the peace process in the Middle East.

His successful efforts at detente with the Soviet Union and the opening to China and his somewhat less successful efforts in other parts of the world

like Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were all while he was national security adviser.

[13:15:01]

But when he became secretary of state, that's when he devoted himself to peacemaking in the Middle East. And that's what I thought was worth looking

at in detail, especially because four presidents, the last four presidents, and two of them I worked with on the peace process, haven't had much

success at it.

And I decided after the last failure that I was involved in, which was the last Israeli-Palestinian negotiations to take place, seven years ago, that

I needed to go back and look at a successful effort, and Kissinger's, all the documents involved, all the protocols of his meetings, and his phone

calls everything, basically, plus the Israeli archives, all open now and available.

And I also thought, Christiane, that it would be useful to take people back into the rooms where diplomacy is done, because I think very few people

understand exactly how diplomacy looks, and have a look at the guy, Kissinger, who is the master of the game.

(CROSSTALK)

AMANPOUR: OK, so that title of your book, of course, and you do -- you seem to have had a huge amount of archives and resources to draw on.

So break down then his philosophy and why his was successful and yours failed, essentially. I mean, from -- I mean, basically, his philosophy was

not idealism, and it wasn't about peace, necessarily, in terms of using that word. It was about order. And it was about pragmatism.

Tell us what that all means.

INDYK: Exactly, Christiane.

It was -- Kissinger was quite skeptical of peace, at least as an endgame, an end to the conflict. He saw that, the effort to pursue an end-of-

conflict peace, as problematic, because if it were pursued with too much passionate, it often achieved, in his study of history, the opposite.

So, for him, peace was, in some ways, a problem, not a solution. And he preferred order, a stable balance of power. But he recognized in the Middle

East, after the outbreak of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, which happened on his watch, that order alone, a stability produced by balance of power alone,

was not enough. There needed to be a peace process to legitimize that order and address the grievances of powers involved in the order, so that they

wouldn't go back to war.

AMANPOUR: So, Martin Indyk, I mean, you say he said there needed to be a process.

All I have ever heard from subsequent administrations, people, like yourself and other colleagues, is about process, the Oslo peace process,

all these processes that have endlessly been carried on over the last several decades since Kissinger and, as you say, have failed.

So, what was his big success? Remind everybody.

(CROSSTALK)

INDYK: Well, he negotiated four Arab-Israeli agreements, the cease-fire in Yom Kippur War, then two agreements between Israel and Egypt, which took

Egypt out of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and then one between Israel and Syria which legitimized Egypt's move out of the conflict, but also

stabilized the situation on the Golan Heights.

And that agreement is lasted to this day and kept the Golan Heights peaceful, even through the civil war in Syria and the efforts by Iran to

advance up on the Golan Heights. So he was indeed successful.

But your point about the process is a good one, because there was a lot of criticism that there was too much process and not enough peace. And it was

a criticism that I also voiced at the time. But what I didn't understand, and I don't think it's generally understood, is that the people that came

after Kissinger and the presidents that came after him, including myself in those efforts, were focused on ending the conflict.

Our process was much less process and much less -- much more focused on peace, reaching out for the Holy Grail of an end of the conflict. That's

what we tried to do at Camp David. That's what we tried to do in the last round of Israeli-Palestinian negotiators. That's what Trump tried to do.

That's what George Bush tried to do when he finally got around to it.

And Kissinger's argument was that there needed to be a gradual, incremental process, step-by-step deployments. That, by the way, is what Rabin

introduced in the Oslo Accords, a step-by-step, three-phase withdrawal, without defining what the outcome would be. But after he was assassinated,

we jumped to try to end the conflict. And then it exploded in our faces.

[13:20:04]

And so I think that is the real lesson, is that...

AMANPOUR: OK, so let me ask you.

INDYK: ... peace process is not a dirty word.

AMANPOUR: And peace and equal rights are also not dirty words. And I use that word because the new Biden administration, in terms of its efforts in

that direction, they keep using the word equal.

That's what ""The Atlantic"" has written about, and statements like Israelis and Palestinians equally deserve to live safely and securely. And you say

this is completely new.

So, new why? Because the Americans were never, what, honest brokers or what?

INDYK: No, we tried to be honest brokers. But we were and remain firmly in Israel's corner.

And to talk about equal rights, it a nice thought. I support it. Who doesn't? But it's not a realistic formula. And, essentially, we have an

interest in Israel having peace with the Palestinians.

But we come at it from a pro-Israel point of view. People often criticize that, saying we can't be an honest broker because of that. But what

Kissinger showed and what has been the case ever since is that the Arabs come to Washington when they want their grievances addressed precisely

because the United States is in Israel's corner.

And they want the United States to use its leverage on Israel to deliver territory that has been taken by Israel in order to -- for them -- their

grievances to be addressed.

AMANPOUR: So do you think there's any likelihood that will happen? And then I want to ask you about Afghanistan in relation to the Middle East.

INDYK: So I think that Joe Biden, when he was vice president, saw very clearly what happened in the last round of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations

that I was involved in.

That was, as I said, seven years ago. And he saw that the parties were further apart at the end of that effort than they were at the beginning.

You can blame that on the mediators, but it also reflected the reality of how the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has deepened, hardened in many ways,

become kind of sclerotic.

And so I don't think Joe Biden, with all of his other priorities, especially the need to address the rise of China, is going to embark on a

new effort to try to end the conflict. But what I argue, based on Kissinger's experience, is that what we need is not an end to the conflict,

but a process that will lead to that, a return to that dirty word that you used, a step-by-step effort, incrementally, to improve the relationship

between the Israelis and the Palestinians, so that we can then go back to a final status negotiation.

The Israeli government, which can't make big steps, because it's a left- right coalition that doesn't agree on what to do about the Palestinians, is beginning to take economic steps. We need to get behind that and get them

to take bigger steps and get them to take political steps, territorial steps as well.

And the Palestinians are beginning to respond positively to that. And that's the kind of peace process that we need.

AMANPOUR: About Afghanistan, you basically said that the exit shows this administration and the United States turning away from that region.

What is the impact of that U.S. turning its attention elsewhere? What would Kissinger have done about that or thought about that? I mean, he's still

alive. What does he think about that?

INDYK: I think one of the advantages I had in writing this book was that I had access to him and interviewed him about 12 times for it. So I have some

idea of what he thinks on this subject. And, at 98, he's still going strong.

One of the -- but the interesting thing about Kissinger and the current situation is that Kissinger engaged in his Middle East diplomacy after the

withdrawal from Vietnam, when, just like Biden and his withdrawal from Afghanistan, putting troops on the ground in the Middle East is not an

option. It wasn't an option for Kissinger then, isn't an option for Biden today.

So he used diplomacy. Biden refers to relentless diplomacy is what's necessary now. That's exactly what Kissinger did, relentless diplomacy.

[13:25:08]

You probably remember how he spent 30 days on the road just to get an Israeli-Syrian agreement, making 13 shuttle trips between Jerusalem and

Damascus to get to get that agreement. And that's the kind of relentless diplomacy that's necessary in Asia, but also in the Middle East.

As we focus on Asia now, in effect, pivot to Asia, we can't just back our backs on...

(CROSSTALK)

AMANPOUR: I need to ask you about that, Martin, because...

INDYK: Yes.

AMANPOUR: Exactly.

But it's quite dramatic, because President Biden last night reiterated that the United States would keep up its commitments to defend Taiwan if there

was a military or other threat from China. The Chinese reacted pretty furiously today, warning the U.S. to -- quote -- ""not send any wrong

signals to the separatist forces of Taiwan independence.""

What do you -- how do you think that's going to go? And, of course, in the Kissingerian mode -- he's the famous one who negotiated the rapprochement

between communist China and the United States in '72.

INDYK: Yes.

Well, I think that, in a Kissingerian mode, what what's necessary here is deterrence, but also an effort to talk to the Chinese in a way and reach an

understanding, so that we don't get into a conflict with them over Taiwan. We need to back them off there.

But if we get involved in a conflict over Taiwan, I'm not at all sure how long the American people are going to be supporting that kind of

confrontation. So I do think that we need both a clear deterrent, way of deterring the Chinese, but also a way of talking to them.

AMANPOUR: Fascinating.

""Master of the Game,"" about Henry Kissinger.

Martin Indyk, thank you so much for joining us.

Now, a recent poll suggests that nearly 80 percent of Republicans want Donald Trump to run again in 2024.

""The Washington Post"" columnist and former conservative Republican Max Boot hoped that people would no longer listen to the siren song of populism

because he blames Trump for leading the growing extremism within the party.

And Max Boot now joins Walter Isaacson to explore why so many Republicans are in his thrall and whether it will help or harm the GOP at the next

elections.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

WALTER ISAACSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Thank you, Christiane.

And, Max Boot, welcome to the show.

MAX BOOT, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Good to be here.

ISAACSON: You have worked for a very long time, a traditional conservative Republican, and now you're calling the Republican Party an existential

threat to democracy.

I mean, those are pretty strong words, meaning they threaten the existence of democracy. Why have you come to that conclusion?

BOOT: Well, I think all you have to do, Walter, is look at the events of the past year.

These are things that we never thought we would see happening. But they happened. Of course, you had a president who refused to accept the election

outcome. That is completely unprecedented in American history. That is the very foundation of any democracy, is that the loser has to accept the

outcome.

And Donald Trump has refused to do that. And not only did he refuse to accept the outcome, but, of course, on January 6, he incited a mob attack

on the U.S. Capitol, again, another completely unprecedented event.

Now, you would think, after Donald Trump had shown that he was willing to destroy American democracy in order to stay in office, you would think

that, at that point, the Republican Party would disassociate itself from Donald Trump.

But, of course, that is not what has happened in the many months since then. Instead, those who question or criticize Donald Trump are being

driven out of the party. Of course, you saw the way that Liz Cheney lost her number three position in the House Republican Caucus because she kept

calling out the big lie.

She refused to repeat the big lie that Donald Trump won the election, and she wants to probe what happened on January 6, and that places certain her

in a distinct, very small minority within the Republican Party, because the rest of the Republican Party has basically gone along with Donald Trump.

In fact, there was just a new poll out which shows that something like 80 percent of Republicans want Trump to run for the presidency again in 2024,

even though he has shown his willingness to wage war on our democracy. And that, unfortunately, places the Republican Party on the authoritarian side

of a democratic-vs.-authoritarian divide.

They are not just anti-democratic, big D Democratic. Right now, they are anti-small-D democratic as well.

ISAACSON: You have said that you have become a single issue voter. And your single issue is protecting democracy.

What does that mean in practice?

[13:30:00]

BOOT: Well, in practice, that means voting for Democrats because unfortunately, at this point in time, we count on Republicans to uphold our

democracy. You had a majority of Republicans on Capitol Hill, especially in the House, even after the horrible attack of January 6th, even after that,

you had a majority that voted to overturn or not accept some of the electoral results of the election. They refuse to accept the results in

some of the states that Donald Trump lost.

And since then, the Republican Party has moved even further toward the big lie, which is now embraced by the majority of the Republican electorate and

opposed by very few Republican elected officials. And, so can you imagine what would happen in 2024 if Republicans control both chambers of Congress

and if they control many of the state legislatures? And once again, you see a result where Donald Trump loses the popular vote by a large margin, but

he's close in the Electoral College vote under those circumstances, can you be -- have any degree of confidence that Republicans would actually

recognize a Democratic victory? I'm very, very concerned that under those circumstances Republicans would

actually carry out the kind of coup attempt that failed in January of this year.

And so, to avoid that horrible scenario, which I think would really be the death nail for our democracy, I think it's imperative to vote for Democrats

right now. And I don't care if you disagree with the Democrats on some issues, I disagree with the Democrats on some issues, but to my mind, you

know, the size of the build back better bill is a lot less important than whether we will continue to be a democracy.

ISAACSON: You were born in Moscow. You came over here as a young child. You became a great scholar. You became a commentator. But you're very

familiar with authoritarian regimes. You write about it a lot and what I would call the collaborationist instinct. What is it about Republican Party

that has made them into collaborationists?

BOOT: You know, that's a great question without an easier or obvious answer, but there is no question that going back for decades, Republicans

have been showing increasing contempt for the truth, increasing willingness to engage in conspiracy theories like the, you know, birtherism nonsense

that helped to bring Donald Trump to power. And you have seen them being willing to flop Democratic norms to win power.

You saw a small example of that in 2000 when the George W. Bush campaign went all out to win a closely contested election over Al Gore. You saw it,

you know, more recently with Mitch McConnell who was been willing to bend the rules into pretzels in order to, for example, avoid confirming Merrick

Garland as President Obama's Supreme Court nominee and during an election year and in 2016. And then, you know, McConnell turns around and confirms a

Trump Supreme Court nominee just days before the 2020 election.

So, I think there has just been a general and growing contempt for Democratic norms within the Republican Party and a growing receptivity to

extremism, to conspiracy theories, to racism, nativism, xenophobia. And Donald Trump came along and turbo charged all of those trends. And I think

it's accurate to say that, you know, prior to Trump, the Republican Party had a substantial extremist minority.

Right now, however, the extremists are the ones who are in control of the entire party and there's been a shameful advocation of responsibility on

the part of the elites, people like Senator McConnell, who know better but refuse to stand up for what they believe is right.

ISAACSON: You work for Mitt Romney, you work for John McCain, and then, for Senator Marco Rubio against Donald Trump.

BOOT: That's one I regret it.

ISAACSON: Yes. So, tell me why you regret it? I mean, he -- what has happened to him? How has he succumbed to that wing of the party that you

were so frightened about?

BOOT: Well, this -- you know, this has been one of the monumental disappointments of my life. A lot of people in the Republican Party that I

once believed in have failed the test of Trump, they have the failed the character test of Trump, including folks like Paul Ryan, but also

certainly, Marco Rubio, who I thought stood for something better in 2015 and 2016. And I remember when I was cheering him, when he was saying that

there's no way that somebody like Donald Trump should be allowed to get his hand on our nuclear weapons.

[13:35:00]

He was saying that Donald Trump was unqualified, unfit to be president, and I applauded that. So, I was shocked when he endorsed Donald Trump. And now,

he's become more Trumpy over time and he actually is emulating Trump in a lot of his cheap shot attacks on the media. Basically, I just think that he

sees it as, to his political advantage, to be Trump's lickspittle, which is probably true in Florida and certainly true in Republican politics but it's

really disappointing to see.

On the other hand, I will add that I'm, you know, still very proud of having worked for Senator Romney because he is somebody who has passed the

character test. He has stood up to Trump. He has called him out. He voted to impeach Trump. So, you know, I think Mitt Romney still represents the

best of the Republican Party. And unfortunately, Marco Rubio represents the worst.

ISAACSON: You've talked at times about Republicans either pretending to be or acting out as if they were the stupid party. I mean, almost

intentionally. And the senator from here in Louisiana, Senator John Kennedy, somebody went to Vanderbilt and Oxford, University of Virginia

plays that role. Explain that phenomenon where people have to sort of pretend if they're going to be Republicans not to be abdicated or --

BOOT: Well, this is kind of the cost of being a populist party. And, of course, what you're saying at this great educational sorting out on

American politics where it used to be the case that college graduates backed the Republican Party. Right now, college graduates increasingly

migrate to the Democratic Party and the Republican Party has become kind of a blue-collar high school graduate party, very strong in rural areas, very

weak in high-income urban areas.

And so, Republican politicians basically adjust themselves to these trends. And some of them, you know, really represent the base. I mean, folks like

Marjorie Taylor Greene who is, you know, I would say, out of her mind. I mean, she is somebody who has embraced QAnon conspiracy theories, has

compared, you know, vaccine mandates to the Nazis, just saying completely crazy, crazy stuff. But then, there are others like John Kennedy and many

others who are much smarter, better educated, know better, but they nevertheless feel compelled to play this corn-pone act.

And Ted Cruz is another great example. All this kind of IV league populists who pretend to be a lot dumber than they are because that's what the

Republican Party wants. And it's -- unfortunately, it's a very destructive and corrosive trend because they wind up, you know, embracing conspiracy

theories about the election and then, they also refuse to acknowledge, for example, the science of climate change, which is not really open for debate

anymore and yet, Republican Party remains in denial about the terrible threat to our planet.

ISAACSON: What about Tucker Carlson, somebody you know? To what extent do you think he's just cynical? To what extent do you think he really believes

this? And how dangerous do you think his campaign against believing in vaccinations has been?

BOOT: Well, the last question is the easiest to answer. I mean, what Tucker Carlson is doing is incredibly dangerous. He has the number one

cable show in America reaching millions of people every night. And when he's not propagating the great replacement conspiracy theory beloved of

white supremacists, he's undermining vaccines. And so, he is really doing great damage to the American body politic and to American health. I mean,

he is endangering people. What he's doing is highly irresponsible. It's a disgrace that Rupert Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch are paying him to do this.

This is just a bane on America.

You asked, you know, Walter, the tougher question, does Tucker actually believe all this nonsense that he peddles? I don't know the answer to that.

I mean, I remember Tucker from, you know, decades ago and we were both working at the ""Weekly Standard"" and he was a -- seemed like a smart

sensible writer. But pretty clearly, he's gone off the deep end, whether out of ideological conviction or simply because it's so lucrative for him

to do so. But either way, he's become a demagogue and truly a menace to America.

ISAACSON: From a historical perspective, why is this happening, this sort of populist anti-science, anti-truth sentiment, not just Donald Trump but

throughout the Republican Party and not just Republican Party? It seems to have permeated elements of society. What's causing it?

BOOT: Well, big picture, I would say, it's probably one of the effects of the economic transition that we are going through right now. Where you're

going through a transition from an industrial to an information age economy, and that has produced some very big winners, you know, like all

the billionaires who run these major websites.

[13:40:00]

And it's also producing a lot of losers. People who have been left behind economically and, you know, those shuttered industrial towns throughout the

Midwest. And it's also producing great disparities of wealth and, you know, we have -- in the U.S., we have one of the highest levels of income

inequality among advanced industrialized democracies.

And so, you know, I think that there is a lot of misery out there, a lot of dissatisfaction. There's also been, you know, frankly, a lot of perceived

failures on the part of the elites in Washington, whether the Iraq War, Afghanistan War, you know, the financial and economic crash in 2008 and

2009. So, there's a lot of dissatisfaction and kind of a lot of people on both the left and right trying to feel like we want to blow it all up, and

that was, you know, a lot of the impetus, of course, for Donald Trump's staggering and surprising victory in 2016.

But I would think -- I would hope that we would learn something from the last four years, which is that demagogues in populous like Donald Trump,

they don't have the answers. They're very good on capitalizing on misery but they can't actually ameliorate it They don't have the answers. I mean,

Donald Trump promised that all the trends of deindustrialization that have been going on for decades would miraculously be reversed under his

presidency, that the trade deficit would disappear. That's all nonsense. None of that happened. The trade definite actually got wider. There was no

change in the deindustrialization.

So, I would hope that after the experience of the Trump presidency, people would wise up a little bit and not listen to the siren song of populism.

ISAACSON: We've had a recent spike in the coronavirus. It now seems to be tamping down a little bit. But you said that instead of blaming Biden for

the recent spike, it's really the Republicans more to blame. Why is that?

BOOT: All you have to do is look at the numbers of people who are getting vaccinated. About 90 percent of Democrats have gotten vaccinated compared

to only 58 percent of Republicans. There is huge and unwarranted skepticism of vaccines on the right, which, again, is being fed every single night by

Fox News channel which glorifies vaccine resisters, even though, by the way, you know, well over 95 percent of Fox's own employees are vaccinated.

It's just this horrible catering to these anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists, anti-Washington populists. And it's utterly shameful the extent

to which the leadership of the Republican Party has connived on this, where, you know, you have Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader,

screaming no vaccine mandates. Well, guess what? We already have vaccine mandates to attend any school in this country including at any red state

that you want to name. Your kids have to have proof they're vaccinated against polio, diphtheria, tuberculosis, various other diseases. So, why is

adding a COVID vaccine suddenly so controversial?

It shouldn't be. This is just this animus against science and elites in -- against the Democratic Party, which is now in charge in Washington, this is

-- these are just the sentiments that have run amuck and they're endangering our country. They are killing people and they are making it

very hard for President Biden to achieve the kind of levels of vaccination that we need to achieve in order to stop the pandemic, and that's -- you

know, I think he's doing a good job with his mandates, but I think it's really shameful, the extent to which the Republican Party, especially in

states like Texas and Florida, is trying to undermine those mandates and they are endangering people's lives to score political points.

ISAACSON: Max Boot, thank you so much for joining us.

BOOT: Thanks for having me.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: And of course, as we've reported, so many strong men and authoritarians around the world look to the United States to get their

cues. So, it is an important conversation.

Now, from American politics to the gallery walls of the art world. A major retrospective of the painter, Paula Rego's work is under way here in

London's Tate Britain Museum. She was born in Portugal and grew under a fascist dictatorship in the 1930s and '40s. And eventually, made Britain

her home. She's known for her uncompromising approach. And Rego has fiercely taken on fascism and also, she's explored women's rights in a

very, very brave way.

Her son, the filmmaker, Nick Willing, has made it a big part his own work to solidify his mother's well-deserved place in history. And he's joining

me now me live from Paula Rego's studio right here in London.

Nick Willing, welcome at that to the program.

[13:45:00]

And I just want to ask you how your mother feels about this amazing recognition. How do you feel about it? Because this is, you know, the

retrospective of all of her work, even pieces that she created when she was ay 15 years old. She's in her 80s now.

NICK WILLING, PAULA REGO'S SON: Well, it's a huge honor for her. But, you know -- and it's a dream come true because she's been knocking at the door

of the Tate for almost all her adult life. But unfortunately, the art world is a world run by men for men until only recently. And so, the fact that

they've actually eventually opened the door to her is, for her, a dream come true.

AMANPOUR: You know, Nick, you're absolutely right and it's important to be reminded that there are very few female artists, you know, exhibited in

these major museums. And I just want to just ask you to reflect on this. Obviously, this retrospective is getting rave reviews. But here's a line

from the F.D. This retrospective proves that no artist has more powerfully subverted male painterly tradition to express the modern female experience,

talking obviously about your mother, Paula Rego. Break that down for us.

WILLING: Well, in the late '80s, she was invited by the National Gallery to be their first artist and residence there. And an artist in residence is

supposed to draw inspiration from the work at the National Gallery. And she initially turned that down because she said, it's a gallery filled with the

work of men about men. And there's nothing really for me there.

But then, a week later, after thinking about that, she rang back and said, well, actually, because it's a gallery of men by men, I want to have a go.

And what she did in some of that work is shown in this exhibition here, this wonderful picture called time, past and present, in which she takes

the classical, even renaissance and baroque painting and structure and symbolism and subverts it in order to reflect female experience.

And that reminds us, I think, that for centuries, millennia, even, the art world has been really just seen through the looking glass of 50 percent of

the population. And women were almost never reflected or shown.

AMANPOUR: I just want to, you know, take note of where you are because your background is amazing and you are obviously in your mother's studio.

And there are all these dolls and there's -- I can see easels and, you know, kind of props and things that turned up in her art. So, the one

picture we have that can talk a little bit about, you know, the sort of props, the dolls, the animal faces that she used to explain certain things

is the one that's called War.

And this -- I want to you to tell me about it because this was triggered by an image that she saw of Iraqi civilians after a bomb explosion in Basra

during the 2003 American, you know, invasion, American intervention there. What was she saying with these rabbit pictures and the other animal heads

that she is using?

WILLING: Well, she saw a photograph of a little girl in the newspaper, of a little girl covered in blood, running towards camera in a dress that she

thought looked very much like the sort of dresses her cousin, Manuela, would wear when she was young. And it really brought the wall very close to

her heart that made it quite personal suddenly to her and she thought, I've got to do something.

And what she chose to do initially when she painted people in violent scenarios, in war-like scenarios, she felt that it looked rather

sentimental and overly melodramatic. And then, of course, typical of my mother's brain, she thought, well, what if I used rabbits? We can do

anything to rabbits and people don't care. So, she made the rabbits out of paper mache, these rather grotesque, rather extraordinary rabbits and tried

to reflect the sense of violence and extreme horror through what is a kind of uncanny image, which is the juxtaposition of a doll which we might see

in children's setting in a violent war-like scenario, which -- and it's the clash of those two opposites that seem to make it more powerful. And I

think that's what --

[13:50:00]

AMANPOUR: Sorry to interrupt you. But I just wanted to pick up what you were saying in your mother's incredible mind, this is what she did. And in

the documentary, you did about her, she talks about what goes through her mind sometimes when she begins a painting. And so, I'm -- or work of art.

I'm going to play a little bit of that conversation that she had with you.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PAULA REGO, PAINTER: When I'm doing a picture and I've got the story and I don't know where to put it, like, you know, the background setting for it,

I go back to a place I knew as a child. I'm really married to my pictures. When I do something that I feel maybe is good, I feel so much better.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: So, I'm really fascinated by what she says. We've explained how she goes back to her childhood to -- in the last picture, we talked about.

But there's a whole series in which she depicts arranged marriages. She has a whole series of the bride. She talks about what women were expected to

do, the less, the better, of a certain class. And we've got this picture called The Bride. And she then, did also a lot of political art. The idea

of, you know, the right to an abortion in Portugal was very, very contentious. A referendum failed, I think, in the late '90s. And then, she

painted people, young women or women who had had to have, let's say, back alley illegal abortions. And apparently, was blamed for having that

referendum pass. Talk to us about her commitment to women's rights.

WILLING: This is her -- those pictures, the abortion pictures which she called Untitled are the pictures that she regards as amongst the most

important that she's ever done. Because she felt so passionate when that first referendum in Portugal failed, because not enough women went out to

vote. They were too embarrassed. They stayed home. And so, she was so incensed. I remember her saying, I went -- we're out to Sunday lunch and I

remember her saying to me, my God. Why don't people realize that this is a public health issue? It's got nothing to do with left and right. It's got

to do with keeping our daughters and our wives and our mothers safe.

Because, of course, backstreet abortions will happen whether you legalize abortion, whether -- even when you don't legalize abortion. So, what she

did is she -- the only thing she knows how, which is set about making a series of pictures in which she casts sometimes schoolgirls as having just

had -- they're not -- they are pictures that describe the emotional turmoil and the pain and the anguish. They're not bloody or horrific pictures.

They're emotional pictures in that sense. And that's what she wanted to do.

And it's true that once they were shown in Portugal, particularly at the Gulbenkian Foundation, it did change a lot of minds. And this is one of the

things that Paula has done for her country of her birth, Portugal, is she's allowed the people to talk about the taboo subjects that they would find

otherwise difficult to discuss. By bringing out into the open, then what happened was chapters started to talk about it, radio shows started to talk

about it. And suddenly, women were encouraged to go out and vote.

And the second time they held the vote in 2007, it did pass. And in fact, the president, Jorge Sampaio, told me that was largely because of her

pictures.

AMANPOUR: It is extraordinary, her impact. And, obviously, this is an amazing retrospective. She also, with her art, you know, combatted fascism

that she'd grown up under and political intolerance. We have a beautiful picture called ""The Dance.""

But over that, I wanted to ask you, which is about generations and it's just gorgeous, and we'll put that up. But I wanted to ask you, is she still

painting? How is your mother? Will she paint some more? What is she focused on right now?

WILLING: She is unwell. Unfortunately. Which is why I'm speaking to you perhaps on the studio rather than her, because she would be here 24/7

otherwise. This is where she lived most of her life, is in her studio, which is her playground. She's unwell. Just recovered from COVID.

[13:55:00]

She had it for -- even though she was double vaxxed, she got COVID. And so, she suffered quite a bit, 10 days in bed with a high temperature. But she's

also had a couple of strokes and has become very, very fragile. She still paints. She still draws. That's the only thing she's ever lived for,

really. And so, she still does it, but it's not as it was.

AMANPOUR: Well, we thank you for being here to talk about her. It's an amazing retrospective. Her art is just incredible. And we wish her all the

best. Thank you so much, Nick Willing.

That is it for now. Good-bye from London."
2021-10-22,Erin Burnett Out Front,CNN,Kate Bolduan,"KATE BOLDUAN, CNN HOST: OUTFRONT next breaking news, the 911 call from the set of Alec Baldwin's movie revealing new details tonight as questions grow over how a cinematographer could be accidentally shot and killed with a prop gun.

Plus, the anti-vax movement about to get the Trump treatment. The former president's son headlining a conference that claims it will reveal the truth about vaccines. What does Eric Trump know about vaccines?

And U.S. Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn on Steve Bannon's refusal to cooperate with the January 6 Committee and the never-before-seen footage of the insurrection that he experienced firsthand. Let's go OUTFRONT.

Good evening, everyone. I'm Kate Bolduan in for Erin Burnett.

OUTFRONT tonight we have breaking news, the 911 call from the tragic shooting on the set of Alec Baldwin's new film, revealing new details about what exactly happened. The call coming in really moments after Baldwin fired to prop gun killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injuring the Director of the film Joel Souza. Listen to this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

911 OPERATOR: What's the location of the emergency?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Bonanza Creek Ranch, we've had two people accidentally shot on a movie set by a prop gun.

911 OPERATOR: So was it loaded with a real bullet or what (inaudible) ... UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't - I cannot tell you that.

911 OPERATOR: Okay.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have two injuries from a movie gun shot.

911 OPERATOR: Okay, we're getting them out there already.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BURNETT: The shooting happened Thursday at a ranch in New Mexico. And tonight, newly surfaced video shows the type of gun training at least one actor received on set just days before the shooting. One of Baldwin's co-stars actually talked about working with the film's armorer.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JENSEN ACKLES, ACTOR: They had me pick my gun. They're like, ""All right. What gun would you like?"" And I was like, ""I don't know."" And the armorer was like, ""You have gun experience?""

JARED PADALECKI, ACTOR: Like, ""What's a gun?""

ACKLES: And I was like, ""A little."" And she's like, ""Okay. Well, this is how you load it. This is how we check it, make sure it's safe."" She's like, ""Okay, I'm going to put some blanks in there and I want you to just go and fire off a couple rounds and towards the hill."" And I was like, ""Okay."" So I put the belt on. I put the gun there and I walked out. And she's like, ""Just make sure that you pull the hammer all the way back and you aim at your target.""

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLDUAN: That exchange giving us something of a glimpse inside the training that the cast received on weapons. Nick Watt is OUTFRONT tonight live in Los Angeles for us. Nick, what more are you learning?

NICK WATT, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kate, a search warrant has been issued for the Bonanza Creek Ranch where this happened and sheriffs tell us that they will be carefully combing it over this weekend. The local DA says at this time we do not know if any charges will be filed.

Now, it seems like this was an accident but the question is was it someone's fault?

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We've had two people accidentally shot on a movie set by a prop gun. We need help immediately.

(END VIDEO CLIP) WATT (voice over): This is the set. The director, Joel Souza, was

injured. The director of photography, Halyna Hutchins was killed. ""Two individuals were shot on the set of Rust,"" According to the Santa Fe, New Mexico Sheriff's office, ""when a prop firearm was discharged by Alec Baldwin.""

Baldwin distraught in the sheriff's parking lot after questioning. ""The investigation remains open and active, no charges have been filed."" A prop firearm should shoot only blanks.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BEN SIMMONS, FIRE ARMS INSTRUCTOR FOR ACTORS, CO-FOUNDER, BARE ARMS: With a blank round, you have everything that you would normally have in a real round but you don't have the bullet on the end of it. So that when it fires you do get the flash, you do you get the bang, you get the recoil, you get the explosion but you don't get the bullet flying out the end of the gun. And it doesn't mean that blank rounds are safe.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WATT (voice over): Hutchins posted this video the day before she died, horse riding on a day off. ""One of the perks of shooting a Western,"" she wrote. Born in Ukraine, Hutchins started out as a journalist then moved to the U.S. to study and work in the movies named a rising star in 2019 by American Cinematographer magazine. She was 42.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JIM HEMPHILL, FILMMAKER AND JOURNALIST: She kind of brought that eye that she had from documentaries and nonfiction filmmaking to, again, action movies and horror movies. So they had this sort of immediacy and realism, as well as this eye beauty that she had and it was really unique look.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WATT (voice over): A death on set like this rare but not unique. Brandon Lee was shot and killed on the set of the Crow in '93.

[19:05:03]

A blank was fired, but dislodged part of a live round stuck in the barrel. In '84, on the set of the show Cover Up, actor Jon-Erik Hexum jokingly put a prop gun to his head and pulled the trigger. The pressure and wadding from the blank killed him.

Rust, starring and produced by Baldwin hinges on the accidental killing of a rancher in 1880's Kansas. This morning, Baldwin tweeted, ""There are no words to convey my shock and sadness. I'm fully cooperating with the police investigation to address how this tragedy occurred. My heart is broken for her husband, their son and all who knew and loved Halyna.""

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WATT (on camera): Now, her husband has spoken to insider and said ""I don't think there are words to communicate the situation."" The bold facts are these, his wife was shot, Hutchins was shot shortly before two o'clock Thursday afternoon. She was helicoptered to a hospital and there she was pronounced dead. Kate?

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLDUAN: So many questions beyond that. Thank you, Nick.

OUTFRONT with me now is Kevin Frazier, host of Entertainment Tonight and John Patteson, a former movie armorer. He also worked on the Brandon Lee film The Crow. Thanks for being here, guys.

Kevin, you've been we're even covering this since this broke. You've been working your sources. What are you hearing tonight?

KEVIN FRAZIER, HOST, ""ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT"": Well, we're hearing what the L.A. Times reported about the union members who walked off the set and they were concerned about the safety on set that there were reports of a gun misfiring before and that they were also concerned about their hotel rooms and being paid.

Now, all of this turns into a situation where they walk off set, and they are replaced by non-union members and then just six hours later this accident happens and people are very upset and also heartbroken.

BOLDUAN: Heartbroken for sure. John, there are lots of safety protocols for weapons on any set. I want to play again what Baldwin's co-star said just days ago about gun training.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JENSEN ACKLES, ACTOR: They had me pick my gun. They're like, ""All right. What gun would you like?"" And I was like, ""I don't know."" And the armorer was like, ""You have gun experience?""

JARED PADALECKI, ACTOR: Like, ""What's a gun?""

ACKLES: And I was like, ""A little."" And she's like, ""Okay. Well, this is how you load it. This is how we check it, make sure it's safe."" She's like, ""Okay, I'm going to put some blanks in there and I want you to just go and fire off a couple rounds and towards the hill."" And I was like, ""Okay."" So I put the belt on. I put the gun there and I walked out. And she's like, ""Just make sure that you pull the hammer all the way back and you aim at your target.""

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLDUAN: Is there anything in what they're describing there that raises any concerns to you? John, can you hear me?

JOHN PATTESON, FMR. MOVIE ARMORER; WORKED ON BRANDON LEE FILM, ""THE CROW"": Oh, yes, yes. I didn't know you were speaking to me. The question again? BOLDUAN: In what one of the actors are describing as some of the

training that they received and how it was described, obviously, a lot of people are looking at it in a different light now.

PATTESON: Oh, yes.

BOLDUAN: Is there anything in what you've heard and how they're describing the safety, the training that they received ahead of filming that raises any concern to you?

PATTESON: Well, yes. It seemed like it was a very cavalier attitude throughout the whole process there on both sides of the camera.

BOLDUAN: I want you both if you could, Kevin, since you were referencing it, the complaints that your sources are talking to you about complaints that you were hearing from onset, can you elaborate more about that?

FRAZIER: Sure, Kate. And I also want to mention that Entertainment Tonight has been contacted by the production company and in a statement they told us that they are launching an internal investigation into everything that happened on the set, but that there were no official complaints.

Now, meanwhile these crew members, according to the L.A. Times had complained about driving 50 miles from Albuquerque each way to the set because they have been promised hotel rooms. They also complained about conditions on the set where allegedly a gun had misfired twice before.

And then they also felt like according to the L.A. Times and these sources that they hadn't been paid. So when these crew members walked off set and they were union members, they were told that if they didn't leave the set that the production was going to call security. They were replaced by non-union members, but that Ms. Hutchins stayed on along with one other camera operator.

[19:10:05]

And if you see this happening, then the tragedy happens so close to the time where they walked off the set and the local IATSE union did offer a statement where they claimed and they talked about what actually went on, that these guns were given to the actors by non- union members. Just to clarify that the people who, they feel, do this a lot weren't there.

BOLDUAN: Now, CNN has not confirmed the reporting, this reporting, I just want to be clear on that. But, John, tell me what you think about Kevin's reporting here?

PATTESON: Well, I'm kind of shocked at it. It sounds like there were a lot of people involved on the periphery that shouldn't have been there and the attitude, as I said before, sounds kind of cavalier about the whole thing. It's something that over the years I've taken very seriously and I've worked with very serious prop masters and weapons people. And it's kind of shocking to hear some of this stuff that the - and again the kind of yahoo attitude about the thing.

The gun doesn't do anything that the person holding it or loading it is capable of doing. I'm really kind of shocked to hear what was going on there. That's not the way it's done or should be done.

BOLDUAN: Yes. Well, there's much more to be learned. Again, CNN has not confirmed the details of that reporting though.

But Kevin, according to officials, detectives, the way they've described it is that detectives are investigating how and what type of projectile was discharged. Like on its most basic, what happened that killed Halyna Hutchins? What are you hearing about this projectile, Kevin?

FRAZIER: Well, in the statement that came from the union, they said that the principal actor discharged a round that then was what hit and killed Ms. Hutchings. So that is in the IATSE statement and we don't know for sure exactly what was in that gun, but it's been described by multiple sources and also the authorities as a live round.

Now, I have been on a lot of sets and when guns are involved, the treatment of those firearms is meticulous and in a lot of sets even during rehearsals, they won't let you even use rubber guns. They make the actors hold up their hands or their finger. So in most situations, guns are handled as dangerous firearms and so there will be a lot of questions about how this weapon with a, what is being described as a live round, then got into Alec Baldwin's hands.

BOLDUAN: Yes. Kevin, thank you very much for being here. John, thank you as well.

Out front for us next, Eric Trump headlining a conference that promises to reveal the truth how they - that's what they say, about the COVID vaccine. When did Eric Trump become a vaccine expert?

Plus, there's also breaking news, a top Trump ally from the Justice Department who tried to help Trump overturn the election now agreeing to meet with the January 6 Select Committee.

And Vice President Kamala Harris telling Democrats to step up and make a deal on Biden's sweeping spending bill. Are they listening?

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[19:17:17]

BOLDUAN: Tonight, Donald Trump's son, Eric, and a longtime political adviser, Roger Stone, headlining a conference this weekend organized by two of the biggest spreaders of COVID vaccine misinformation on social media. One organizer telling a news outlet that she expects 2,000 people to attend.

It comes as President Biden is warning about the danger of vaccine misinformation even directly taking on Fox News, a hotbed of vaccine lies during his CNN Town Hall.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The gross misinformation is out there like what they're saying about my buddy Colin Powell and he was my friend who passed away. Colin Powell was vaccinated he still died.

Well, he knew he had serious underlying conditions and it would be difficult. He clearly would have been gone earlier had he not gotten the vaccine, had he not gotten the shots. But my generic point is there's so much misinformation.

You know what I find fascinating? I turn on Fox to find out how popular I am, but all kidding aside, one of the things I find, you realize they mandate vaccinations.

ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR, ""ANDERSON COOPER 360"": At Fox headquarters.

BIDEN: Yes. I find that mildly fascinating.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLDUAN: But to their credit, some Republicans are standing up to this misinformation. Here's New Hampshire's Republican Governor Chris Sununu speaking to Erin last night about how he takes on vaccine misinformation being pushed in his state.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R) NEW HAMPSHIRE: When crazy comes knocking at the door, you got to slam it shut.

ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST: Yes.

SUNUNU: There's just absolutely no place for the misinformation, the crazy conspiracy theories, all that kind of nonsense. I don't care what party you're from.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLDUAN: He's right.

OUTFRONT now, Dr. Jonathan Reiner. He advised the White House medical team under President George W. Bush and Brian Stelter, Anchor of RELIABLE SOURCES, CNN Chief Media Correspondent.

Dr. Reiner, the website for this weekend event promises a conference that 'reveals the truth about vaccines'. Trump's son and Roger Stone will be speaking, neither a doctor. This is dangerous what's happening. Why are some people so obsessed with conspiracy theories surrounding vaccines?

JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Well, Kate, I think, in the United States, fear and ignorance have always been a very toxic mixture. In this country, it's fueled racism, and anti-Semitism and xenophobia. And now in this pandemic, it's fueled of vaccine hesitancy or refusal and it's being promulgated on Facebook and through conservative news outlets like Fox News.

You can turn Fox News on almost every night and cynically you see folks like Tucker Carlson, not out and out telling folks not to get vaccinated but asking questions.

[19:20:09]

Just asking questions. Now, this event in Nashville is ironically or maybe not ironically being held in a state with one of the worst rates of vaccination in the United States, only about 48 percent of the citizens of that state are fully vaccinated, about 20 percent lower than the national average.

So they're going into a place with people who have great doubts about vaccines and are now spreading out and out falsehood. What is Eric Trump going to do? He's going to he's going to say that his father's vaccine, the vaccine that his father takes full credit for is somehow a fraud? What is he there to do?

BOLDUAN: That is a great question, Dr. Reiner. Brian, you heard also Biden go directly at Fox News about all of this. I mean, one of Fox's longtime anchors Neil Cavuto. He's a cancer survivor who also has a mass and he's announced that he had tested positive for COVID.

And as part of his statement announcing his positive test result, he also said this in his statement. He said, ""Had I not been vaccinated and with all my medical issues, this could be a far more dire situation. I hope anyone and everyone gets that message loud and clear. Get vaccinated, for yourself and everyone around you.""

You've noted that Fox News has been silent on Cavuto's endorsement of vaccines even in the world of hard to believe that many people live in over there. That's still shocking.

BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: They have not covered the statement. They have not read this statement out loud the way you have on CNN there. Other channels have been giving Cavuto's statement more attention than the network he works out.

Look, he tested positive on Monday. He's reportedly doing well. He's well enough to give an interview on television this weekend. Hopefully, he will have a very mild case and get to the other side of it.

But the idea that one of Fox's top most veteran anchors get sick with COVID and promotes vaccines, encourages viewers to vaccines and then Fox ignores it doesn't read the statement, doesn't talk about him, only gives viewers brief updates on his condition doesn't share his words with the public, it is disgraceful.

And it's evidence of what Dr. Reiner was saying about this conservative media apparatus that has prolonged the pandemic by standing in the way of progress. Look, I'm glad we are reading the statement. I'm glad we are sharing it, because Fox is not and it's a sign of a broader illness, frankly, on the right and on right-wing media. BOLDUAN: Dr. Reiner, it may not be surprising at this point to hear

misinformation about the vaccines on Fox News, but it is also now coming from Florida's new Surgeon General who yesterday questioned the vaccine's safety with no evidence, listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DR. JOSEPH LADAPO, FLORIDA'S STATE SURGEON GENERAL: Part of the reason that people are not comfortable, some people are not comfortable with these vaccines is because the climate of dishonesty, scientific dishonesty about the science, the reality of how safe these vaccines are is absolutely not public.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLDUAN: The reality of how safe they are is not public, meaning - I guess, he's not necessarily saying there it's not safe, but it is safe. I mean, he's claiming doctors are lying or not telling the truth or hiding the safety and efficacy of vaccines. He is a medical doctor and he specializes, Dr. Reiner, in cardiovascular disease. What do you say to him?

REINER: Well, I'm ashamed of him. Look, he's the Surgeon General of that state. And the Surgeon General of the United States or any state in the union, their job is to be an advocate for the people who live in that state, to help protect them from illness and injury and to tell them the truth about their health and how to promote their health.

And what Dr. Ladapo is doing is actually lying to the public about the safety of vaccines. So let me just say it straight out. These vaccines have been incredibly vetted. They've been given to hundreds of millions of Americans and billions of people around the world. He needs to tell the truth to his citizens.

He reminds me of Scott Atlas, Gov. DeSantis' acolyte. Donald Trump, Gov. DeSantis' idol, broad into basically toe the line when Trump was president.

BOLDUAN: Dr. Reiner, thank you for coming on. Great to see you, Brian. Thank you so much.

OUTFRONT for us next, U.S. Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn is my guest. Why he says he believes Steve Bannon committed a crime. And his reaction to the never-before-seen footage of the deadly insurrection that he experienced firsthand.

Plus, the lawyer for Brian Laundrie's family revealing new information about Brian's mental state before his fiance, Gabby Petito, was found dead.

[19:25:07]

Did the attorney say too much?

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [19:29:08]

BOLDUAN: Breaking news, CNN learning Jeffrey Clark, the former top Justice Department official who tried to help Donald Trump push the big lie and overturn the election, he's agreeing to meet with the January 6 Select Committee next Friday. This after a new HBO documentary called Four Hours at the Capitol reveals previously unseen and disturbing footage of the deadly insurrection video that is extremely hard to watch, especially for those who lived it including my next guest, U.S. Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, who told us he just brought himself to be able to watch the whole thing. Here is some of the new footage of an attack on his fellow officer, Michael Fanone.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

OFC. MICHAEL FANONE, DC METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT: I remember just kind of getting pounded from every side and then I remember people yelling out to get his gun. Kill him with his gun.

[19:30:05]

And then, I started getting tased at the base of my skull. And it was excruciatingly painful.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLDUAN: OUTFRONT with me now is Officer Harry Dunn.

That's so hard to -- it's -- we've seen so many angles, Harry, it's so hard to see it. I do want to point out, just you are speaking on your own personal capacity tonight. Not speaking for the U.S. Capitol Police. But thank you so much for being here.

OFFICER HARRY DUNN, U.S. CAPITOL POLICE: Thank you. Thank you for having me on. I appreciate it.

BOLDUAN: I know you just watched that entire documentary. Nine months later, Officer Dunn, have you been able to make sense of that day?

DUNN: No, just bluntly, no. I have been able to -- I got to meet Michael Fanone. We've become pretty good friends over the last couple months. Two completely different individuals, completely different backgrounds, fighting for the same rights, for the same dignity, for the same justice.

I've seen his body-camera footage over and over, again. I've heard his stories over and over, again. And just seeing it just then, it still just -- it's rough to watch. It's really rough to watch. But yeah, go back to your question, no, it doesn't make any sense. I -- I still can't fathom it. So --

BOLDUAN: It is -- it is so vivid. It is so visceral. It's so -- it's so absurdly shocking to see it. And it's so many angles of it.

I mean, it is offering -- it -- it -- the documentary offers firsthand accounts from officers like yourself. From lawmakers who were targeted. Also, offers firsthand accounts from protestors and rioters.

And I want to play for you what the founder of Cowboys for Trump said is -- said in the documentary. And I said -- I mean, he makes -- he tries to say that it wasn't Donald Trump's supporters who attacked.

DUNN: Yeah.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think that you're really stretching whenever you say that it was supporters of president Trump that did it. Just because somebody has a Trump shirt on or a Trump hat on, can you guarantee that that person is a Trump supporter? You have to be very careful with assumptions.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLDUAN: You were there. I mean, what do you say to someone trying to argue that?

DUNN: I don't have to be careful with assumptions. They told us they were there because Donald Trump sent them. Donald Trump told us to come. That dude is nuts. Period.

I -- that -- I guess that's one thing I did say about the documentary. They couldn't find a decent guy to talk -- well, I guess there weren't many decent people there so I guess the pickings of who to talk to that day, it was slim.

But there was no assumptions. They said out their own mouth that Donald Trump sent us. So, whatever.

BOLDUAN: It's -- it's -- I find myself grasping for words to try to talk about it. I see, honestly, Harry, I see the anger bubble up in you just even talking about this again.

DUNN: It's frustrating. I tell you what, though, one thing about that day -- and excuse me, that documentary -- I've said it a couple times that if you ask a hundred different people to tell us what happened January 6th, you would get 100 different answers, 100 different horror stories if you talked to 100 different officers.

It wasn't just the officers that day who were under attack, the staff people that worked in the building were under attack, the Congress. Everybody suffered some sort of trauma that day. It wasn't just us, police officers.

So I want to make that clear. Yeah, the police officers, we took the physical brunt of it. But there was a lot to -- a lot that went on that day that -- that traumatized a lot of people in this country. People have reached out to me said I was justice watching it o TV and it was just hard, hurtful and hard to watch. So a lot of people experienced some trauma that day. So --

BOLDUAN: Journalists reporting on it from inside have experienced a lot of trauma from it, too, from -- a lot of my friends talking about that, as well.

DUNN: Yeah. They -- they have. I have talk today a few of them, too. And you have.

BOLDUAN: I want to read for you what Donald Trump said just this week about this, because this gets to an important point of where -- where this conversation has gone.

[19:35:09]

He said the insurrection took place on November 3rd. Election day. January 6th, he says, was the protest. And I -- in seeing that, wanted to ask you are you around about how much this has turned even further from the truth? From Republicans arguing that this wasn't that bad? To now, trying to say it didn't happen at all?

DUNN: It's troubling. It's troubling but it's not surprising. The longer people keep telling themselves lies, the -- the more they continue to believe it themselves. So, of course, his supporters and -- they are going to continue to believe him because they believe in them -- in him.

And if they have to go back on saying, you know what? Maybe, he was wrong. That makes them look bad. So they will just continue to double down, triple down, and just push it until -- who knows what happens next? But I'm not surprised. It's just disappointing, though.

BOLDUAN: Yeah. I just continuously wonder with fear where this all goes. Where does this end up? And that is the sad and terrifying kind of unknown right now. That's what the committee is about that is investigating and trying to get answers to exactly what happened, to try to avoid what I fear where this all ends up.

Thank you, Officer Dunn, for coming on.

DUNN: Thank you for having me. I appreciate it.

BOLDUAN: Really appreciate it. OUTFRONT for us next. President Biden laying out the harsh reality of what's in his sweeping spending bill. And what's not.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: These American family plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. Can't get 12 weeks.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BURNETT: But is he also breaking promises?

BOLDUAN: And the body of Brian Laundrie could soon reveal a secret that has stumped investigators for weeks.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[19:41:01]

BOLDUAN: New tonight. We'll get this done. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi vowing that Democrats will reach a deal on President Biden's sweeping economic agenda. A deal they had hoped would be hammered out by today.

But it clearly has not been, as Democrats remain divided over what exactly is in the bill and what is now going to be getting cut.

Vice President Kamala Harris sent members of Congress this message today.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So, I'm here today to ask people to see this moment for what it is, and to step up. We can do this. It is the right thing to do.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLDUAN: OUTFRONT now, Democratic congressman from New York, Jamaal Bowman. He was with the vice president at this event earlier today.

Congressman, thanks for coming in.

So Speaker Pelosi says that she is hopeful there could be votes next week on the spending bill and the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Is that realistic to you?

REP. JAMAAL BOWMAN (D), NEW YORK: Yes, it is s. We've been working and negotiating around the clock to make sure we get this done. You know, discussions are happening at the White House with both progressives and moderates. And we are getting closer to being on the same page.

Now, everyone, you know, neither side is going to get everything that they want. But some of the essential provisions that progressives were looking for, like childcare, 3K programs, violence reduction, and some climate action are still parts of the bill at this time. But it's -- a lot is still being negotiated and like I said, we're all working around the clock.

BOLDUAN: President Biden -- I mean, he has made a lot of promises about what he wanted to see in this spending bill. As -- as the long lead-up to this. I want to play you some of those promises up against what is the reality that he laid out in the CNN town hall.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLPI)

BIDEN: Big corporations and super wealthy have to start paying their fair share of taxes. It's long overdue. She says she will not raise a single penny in taxes on the corporate side and/or on wealthy people. And then, I want to add two years of free community college for everyone. And we can afford it.

Mr. Manchin and one other person has indicated they will not support free community college. These American family plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid

family and medical leave.

And the reason it's down to four, because they can't get 12 weeks.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLDUAN: There was a lot about a lot that we heard last night. Do you see the deal that's coming together as breaking promises?

BOWMAN: I do not. First of all, I want to applaud President Biden for being at the table for so long. Negotiating, both, the bipartisan infrastructure framework as well as the Build Back Better Act. He is very involved. He understands the importance -- importance of this, especially, as we respond to COVID.

The president had a vision, you know, and I align with his vision to invest at least $6 trillion into our economy and to deal with the issues that are catastrophic, like climate change and many others.

But he is not King Biden. He is not Emperor Biden. He's President Biden. And he has to work within the framework of Congress and our democracy.

And the majority of Democrats are working in alignment with him. Unfortunately, there are one or two, particularly in the Senate, who have their own agenda that doesn't align with polling, doesn't align with the working class, and doesn't align with the majority of Congress.

So, he's still negotiating and we're still working with him. But he's not King Biden, he's President Biden and we have a democracy.

BOLDUAN: So, one of the people you are talking about is Kyrsten Sinema and she's made clear she does not support tax hikes on corporations.

[19:45:03]

Biden laid that out last night. Senate Democrats are now looking at what they are calling a billionaires' tax. It would raise hundreds of billions off of the richest of the rich, about 700 people. Would you support that instead of the initial tax hike plan to pay for this thing?

BOWMAN: Well, I would like for both things to happen. I think it's far past time for large corporations to pay their fair share.

BOLDUAN: But if it doesn't because of the makeup of how this deal's coming together, what do you think of that?

BOWMAN: Well, you asked me what I want. What I want is large corporations paying their fair share, international corporations paying their fair share, a billionaire's tax, taxes on unrealized capital gains, as well as a polluters pay climate fund because we know the top polluters of our environment. Those who have been the biggest contributors to climate change, we know who they are and they should pay into a fund to help us clean up the climate. As opposed to what's been happening, which we continue to give subsidies to fossil fuel industries, without holding them accountable for the climate damage they have caused.

BOLDUAN: So how to pay for this is still not decided. That's what I hear tonight. Thank you so much, Congressman, for coming in.

BOWMAN: Thank you so much. Good to be here.

BOLDUAN: They're making progress but they're definitely not there yet.

OUTFRONT next, Brian Laundrie's remains now in the hands of a forensic anthropologist who could soon answer the question that has stumped investigators.

And China with a warning tonight for President Biden who vowed to protect Taiwan in CNN's town hall.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[19:50:15]

BOLDUAN: Tonight, the Laundrie family's attorney confirming Brian Laundrie's remains have been handed over to a forensic anthropologist. That's someone who will study skeletal remains to determine how a person died.

It comes as the Laundries' attorney says Brian's parents knew he was, quote, grieving when he left their home and headed to the nature reserve. And that was six days before his fiancee, Gabby Petito's body was found.

Leyla Santiago is OUTFRONT.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

LEYLA SANTIAGO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Tonight, so many unanswered questions following the news of Brian Laundrie's death. Today, his parents receiving flower deliveries at their home while their lawyer has been speaking out on their behalf.

STEVE BERTOLINO, LAUNDRIE FAMILY ATTORNEY: Yesterday was, you know, very hard on them. As I'm sure everybody can imagine.

SANTIAGO: While the FBI confirms the skeletal remains found in the Carlton Reserve were Brian Laundrie's, the family attorney says the family had discussed the possibility of suicide.

BERTOLINO: You know, we had that conversation between the three of us, Chris, Roberta, and myself, several times. You know, we just do not know, of course, knowing his mental state when he walked out the door, it was always a concern.

SANTIAGO: These new details raising more questions about what the family knew the night Brian disappeared.

BERTOLINO: Brian had been extremely upset. Chris and Roberta were very concerned about him. They expressed that to me that when he walked out the door that evening, they wish they could have stopped him. They wish they could have, you know, prevented him from going out but he was intent on leaving. And -- and Chris said to me, you know, in hindsight, I know I couldn't stop him.

GABBY PETITO, YOUTUBER: Never goes outside.

SANTIAGO: Why Brian was extremely upset, their attorney wouldn't say. But this was six days before Gabby's body was found at a campsite in Wyoming.

BERTOLINO: I been quite clear on this from the is beginning when it comes to the FBI, we have absolutely nothing to say with respect to the Gabby Petito incident. With respect to Brian, we have been cooperating from day one.

And, you know, those are two different -- from a legal perspective -- those are two different scenarios.

SANTIAGO: Along with Brian's remains, police say a backpack, a notebook, and clothing belonging to him were also found nearby.

BRIAN LAUNDRIE, GABBY PETITO'S FIANCE: So, we are --

SANTIAGO: But whether they will provide any answers about what happened to his fiancee Gabby Petito is still unknown. The notebook, a possible key to so many unanswered questions as to what happened to Brian and Gabby. But finding those clues could take time.

JOSH TAYLOR, SPOKESMAN, NORTH PORT POLICE: That will need to be processed. Want to make sure that's handled as carefully as possible. You only get one shot at these types of items. To hurry up and, you know, rifle through that potentially damaging it would, you know, would not be helpful.

SANTIAGO: As for how Brian Laundrie died, that remains an unanswered question.

Were there any weapons found?

TAYLOR: I can't get into that information.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

SANTIAGO (on camera): And, Kate, as you mentioned earlier, his I remains, the remains found here at this reserve have been sent to a forensic anthropologist. This will be the next step for forensic -- or excuse me -- for investigators to try to get to the bottom of not only the manner of death, but also the cause of death in the case of Brian Laundrie.

BOLDUAN: Leyla, thank you so much for that. OUTFRONT with me now is Tim Clemente, former FBI special agent. He was

part of the search team who tracked the Olympic Park bomber, Eric Rudolph.

Tim, you heard from Leyla the morning the Laundrie family attorney said Brian -- Brian's parents described him as upset when he left the house. And that they wished that they would have stopped him. There are so many questions around their actions that everyone reads into anything the attorney says because he says so little.

What -- what questions does this raise for you?

TIM CLEMENTE, FORMER FBI SPECIAL AGENT: It raises all the questions I could possibly imagine anyone thinking of. What did they know? When did they know it?

Clearly, Gabby's body wasn't found for six days after he left but where was she? And it didn't even occur to them apparently to ask him? They haven't put that information forward as far as he returns with her vehicle without her. It's his fiancee. She's not with him. Is he upset because they broke up?

Okay. Where is she? How is she? How is she doing? But it seems like the parents were only concerned with the wellbeing of their son, and not with his future bride to be.

BOLDUAN: When Brian's remains were found, the FBI -- was able to confirm, like, within a day that it was him. And today, now his remains were sent to a forensic anthropologist.

What does that mean to you? What do you think that means? I mean, do you see that as a delay in sharing his cause of death?

CLEMENTE: No, I think they have to determine that. The problem with the situation when a body has been in a wet environment, especially, for several weeks now possibly five weeks in that one place, the decomposition, alone, could be almost 100 percent of the -- all the soft tissue.

[19:55:14]

So you may be lift with mostly just a skeleton. Now, if he took pills to overdose to kill himself, if he shot himself, if he slit his wrist. If you use one of those forms of killing yourself, there is the possibility that you would see slash marks on the wrist bones or perhaps a bullet hole in the skull. Something like that is very evident, very easy to see.

But you still have to prove that that was him that did it. And so, there had to be a weapon on scene. The answer we heard from the officer saying I can't get into that about whether or not there was a weapon on scene leads me to believe there might have been.

BOLDUAN: As with everything with this, the questions remain and more can be learned. Thank you, Tim. Appreciate it.

OUTFRONT next, tension between the U.S. and China hitting a new high tonight as Beijing warns Biden not to interfere with Taiwan.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BOLDUAN: Tonight, China warning the U.S. against sending any wrong signals on Taiwan. China's foreign ministry saying, quote, no foreign or outside interference is tolerated. This is after President Biden in a CNN town hall talked about how he would respond if Beijing attacked Taiwan.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

QUESTION: Can you vow to protect Taiwan?

BIDEN: Yes and yes. I just want to make China understand that we are not going to step back, we are not going to change any of our views.

ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: So are you saying that -- that the United States would come to Taiwan's defense if China attacked?

BIDEN: Yes, we have a commitment to do that.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLDUAN: The White House immediately clarifying Biden's comments, though, saying there is no change to America's longstanding policy of strategic ambiguity toward Taiwan.

But Beijing heard that -- what Biden said and the stakes couldn't be higher, as China sends a record number of warplanes into Taiwan's defense zone, including fighter jets and nuclear-capable bombers.

Thanks for joining us tonight. I'm Kate Bolduan."
