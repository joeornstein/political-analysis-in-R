```{r setup, include=FALSE}

This week, we expand our data visualization repertoire, exploring different kinds of data (e.g. distributions, change over time) and making our charts prettier and prettier.

## Reading Assignments

Before next week, please read and annotate [Wrangling Penguins](https://allisonhorst.shinyapps.io/dplyr-learnr/), by Allison Horst. You'll learn what to do when your data doesn't come to you *exactly* the way you want it.
