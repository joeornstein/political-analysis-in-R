This week, we review the entire data analysis pipeline from start to finish: how to find the data, import it, clean it up, summarize it, and build a visualization.

## Reading Assignments

Next week, we start making maps! Before then, please read:

- [Healy Chapter 7](https://socviz.co/maps.html)


## Team Project

Reproduce Figure 1.8 (or Figure 1.9, your choice) from [Chapter 1](https://socviz.co/lookatdata.html) of the Healy book. You can ignore the shaded confidence interval, but add six countries not included in the original plot.[^fn1] Write a report in RMarkdown including your chart, and submit the report to eLC as a knitted PDF. 

[^fn1]: I want to know what this trend looks like in, for example, non-democratic countries!
