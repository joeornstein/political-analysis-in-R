```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

This week, we will make sure that everything we need is installed and working on our computers. Make sure you've completed everything from the [Getting Started](index.html#getting-started) section on the home page.

## Reading Assignments

Before next week, please read and annotate the following:

- [Healy Preface](https://socviz.co/index.html#preface) (and complete the package installation instructions at the bottom)
- [Healy Chapter 2](https://socviz.co/gettingstarted.html#gettingstarted)

## Team Project

Find the file `R/week-01/team-project-1.Rmd` in our GitHub repository. Open it and make the following edits:

1. Change the author metadata to list each person on your team.
2. Modify the equation in the second code chunk so it computes 3 times 4.
3. Knit to HTML.
4. Submit the knitted HTML document to eLC[^1] 

[^1]: Everyone on the team needs to submit to eLC in order to receive credit, even if you worked together. (It just makes it easier for me. Thanks!)
