## Team Project

Find the file `R/week-01/team-project-1.Rmd` on our GitHub repository. Download it to your project folder, and make the following changes:

1. Change the author metadata to list each person on your team.
2. Modify the equation in the second code chunk so it computes 3 times 4.
3. Knit to HTML.
4. Submit the knitted HTML to eLC[^1] 

[^1]: Everyone on the team needs to submit to eLC in order to receive credit, even if you worked together. (It just makes it easier for me. Thanks!)
