```

In the final three weeks of class, we will set aside time for bonus topics and final projects. If there is any particular topic or dataset you would like to look at in our final weeks, please complete the form below.

```{r}
knitr::include_url('https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScc68rTkXYbZF6eqYMAYrzlm6mNJRXRWGFlNbe2k4fql1bRyw/viewform?usp=sf_link')
```

We will also take a day to collectively agree on a [grading rubric](syllabus/POLS-3230-final-rubric.xlsx) for the final projects.
